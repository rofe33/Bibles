n the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the evening and the morning were the third day.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

hus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

ow the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Cain said unto the Lord , My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord , and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And God spake unto Noah, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord ; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

nd the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And said, My Lord , if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Is any thing too hard for the Lord ? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord , to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord .
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord , which am but dust and ashes:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord : Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord ; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord :
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord :
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Abraham said, I will swear.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord , for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

nd Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I will make thee swear by the Lord , the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he said O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord ; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, The Lord , before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for my master's son.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord , and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord : we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the Lord , bowing himself to the earth.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
\*[SUP]59\*[SUPX]And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
\*[SUP]60\*[SUPX]And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
\*[SUP]61\*[SUPX]And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
\*[SUP]62\*[SUPX]And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
\*[SUP]63\*[SUPX]And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
\*[SUP]64\*[SUPX]And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
\*[SUP]65\*[SUPX]For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
\*[SUP]66\*[SUPX]And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
\*[SUP]67\*[SUPX]And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord .
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

nd there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord , and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the Lord .
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

hen Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the Lord hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the Lord : therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And she called his name Joseph; and said, The Lord shall add to me another son.

\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?

\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

nd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord ; and the Lord slew him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the thing which he did displeased the Lord : wherefore he slew him also.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

nd Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.

nd it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

nd it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

ow when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he put them all together into ward three days.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.

\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.

nd he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord .
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

nd there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am : and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the Lord , O my Lord , I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord ?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said, O my Lord , send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord , Israel is my son, even my firstborn:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him, and sought to kill him.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.

\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

nd afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord , neither will I let Israel go.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Moses returned unto the Lord , and said, Lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord :
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Moses spake before the Lord , saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]That the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, so did they.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.

\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.

\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he shall command us.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.

\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know not with what we must serve the Lord , until we come thither.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord , About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord 's passover.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord 's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the Lord , as ye have said.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord , let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]This day came ye out in the month Abib.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord .
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord 's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the Lord 's.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord . And they did so.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord , which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord : and what are we, that ye murmur against us?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord : for he hath heard your murmurings.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord : bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]So the people rested on the seventh day.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord , to be kept for your generations.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

nd all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord , and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the Lord ?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Moses cried unto the Lord , saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord , saying, Is the Lord among us, or not?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For he said, Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord , sanctify themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the Lord , The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest he break forth upon them.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord God.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord 's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord , even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Moses returned unto the Lord , and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the Lord , See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord : for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord , whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord God, the God of Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord ; as the Lord had commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he lighted the lamps before the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord , before the altar.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the Lord made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the Lord ; it shall be wholly burnt.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord : it is most holy.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord , having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the Lord , even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord , even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation unto the Lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office;
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Which the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord , in the wilderness of Sinai.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.

\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the Lord , he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord .

\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord ; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the Lord will appear unto you.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord commanded.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire: for so I am commanded.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the Lord ; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the Lord hath commanded.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord ?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord ; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord ?

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord , and the other lot for the scapegoat.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord 's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the Lord , to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord , and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the Lord commanded Moses.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the Lord for a burnt offering;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the Lord , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord , offer it at your own will.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the Lord which hallow you,

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the Lord : thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.

\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

nd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord , all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord , then he shall present the beast before the priest:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord , then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the Lord , as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord 's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the Lord 's.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord 's: it is holy unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the Lord spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the Lord , and that person be guilty;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord , even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the Lord :
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord , and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The Lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the Lord , and offer it upon the altar:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the Lord , and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the Lord , to make an atonement for the Levites.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the Lord .

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the Lord ; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the Lord burnt among them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the Lord , Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord , saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the Lord will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the Lord which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Is the Lord 'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the Lord , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord 'S people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.

\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

nd all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: fear them not.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the Lord , Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people, that thou Lord art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX](Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord , as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]I the Lord have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the Lord .
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord ? but it shall not prosper.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the Lord , therefore the Lord will not be with you.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord .

\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord , to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord ?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the Lord will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the Lord to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the Lord doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord : and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the Lord , Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the Lord , thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the Lord hath not sent me.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And there came out a fire from the Lord , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the Lord , therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the Lord ; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord .
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.

\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord ; the plague is begun.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the Lord , I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord , even a tenth part of the tithe.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the Lord 'S heave offering to Aaron the priest.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the Lord , of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord ; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the Lord : the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord !
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Moses took the rod from before the Lord , as he commanded him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the Lord , and he was sanctified in them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when we cried unto the Lord , he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Moses did as the Lord commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

nd when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord , and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord , and against thee; pray unto the Lord , that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord , What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the Lord spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and og the king of bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at edrei.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do less or more.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will say unto me more.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord , I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the Lord spoken?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.

nd when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honour.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord , to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Moses brought their cause before the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses spake unto the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Let the Lord , the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord : at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Moses did as the Lord commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:

nd Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]If a man vow a vow unto the Lord , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord , and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the Lord shall forgive her.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the Lord shall forgive her.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]These are the statutes, which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

nd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the Lord of Midian.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the Lord .
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And threescore and one thousand asses,
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the Lord 'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the Lord 'S tribute was threescore and twelve.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the Lord 'S tribute was threescore and one.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the Lord 'S tribute was thirty and two persons.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord 'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX](Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And thirty and six thousand beeves,
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And sixteen thousand persons;)
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]We have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord , what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the Lord .
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord , of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX](For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord .

ow the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord hath given them?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord 'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the Lord 'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the Lord , was consumed.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the Lord to war,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord , until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the land be subdued before the Lord : then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the Lord , and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord .
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord : and be sure your sin will find you out.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the Lord , and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]These are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

nd the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel.

nd the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord , saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fathers brothers' sons:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]These are the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

hese be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX](There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX](The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]The Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God,
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord .
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord , we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord , and went presumptuously up into the hill.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And ye returned and wept before the Lord ; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.

hen we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the Lord gave unto them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the Lord sware unto them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]That the Lord spake unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX](That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX](As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the Lord our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us:
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us.

hen we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX](Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall fight for you.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]O Lord God , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

ow therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the Lord shall lead you.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX](For the Lord thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God; there is none else beside him.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX](I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you the word of the Lord : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not kill.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Neither shalt thou steal.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the Lord thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the Lord thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Understand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the Lord hath said unto thee.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And I fell down before the Lord , as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you. But the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the Lord to wrath.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the Lord had said he would destroy you.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]I prayed therefore unto the Lord , and said, O Lord God , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.

t that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God promised him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy thee.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]To keep the commandments of the Lord , and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord 's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]A land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And then the Lord 's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, The Lord Thy God ;
\*[SUP]59\*[SUPX]Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
\*[SUP]60\*[SUPX]Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.
\*[SUP]61\*[SUPX]Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.
\*[SUP]62\*[SUPX]And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord thy God.
\*[SUP]63\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\*[SUP]64\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.
\*[SUP]65\*[SUPX]And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
\*[SUP]66\*[SUPX]And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:
\*[SUP]67\*[SUPX]In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
\*[SUP]68\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

hese are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the Lord thy God, and into his oath, which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX](For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the Lord hath laid upon it;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]That then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord , and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

nd Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath said.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord , he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and unto all the elders of Israel.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord ; and how much more after my death?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Because I will publish the name of the Lord : ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Do ye thus requite the Lord , O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For the Lord 's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord , the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]In all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord 's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And she said unto the men, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord , since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the Lord hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the Lord spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the Lord passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord : unto whom the Lord sware that he would not shew them the land, which the Lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord .
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord .

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the Lord : only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the Lord : they shall come into the treasury of the Lord .

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.

\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]O Lord , what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the Lord shall take shall come by households; and the household which the Lord shall take shall come man by man.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord , and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the Lord .
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

nd the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX](For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the Lord which he commanded Joshua.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal,
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord , and sacrificed peace offerings.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord , as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

nd it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord , even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

ow it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the Lord delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]As the Lord commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.

nd these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]By lot was their inheritance, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]As the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the Lord my God.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

here was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the Lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side Jordan.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord charged you, to love the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord , What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the Lord , in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord ?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord ,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord ? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord , that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord , wherein the Lord 's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the Lord , nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord , (save us not this day,)
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]That we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the Lord himself require it;
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the Lord : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord .
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the Lord before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the Lord .
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord , which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord , and turn this day from following the Lord , to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the Lord our God that is before his tabernacle.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the Lord is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord : now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord .
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But cleave unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God promised you; so shall the Lord bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when they cried unto the Lord , he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now therefore fear the Lord , and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord , choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord , to serve other gods;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For the Lord our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Lord drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the Lord ; for he is our God.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord : for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]If ye forsake the Lord , and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord , to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord , died, being an hundred and ten years old.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the Lord , that he had done for Israel.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

ow after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the Lord , saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the Lord was with them.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

nd an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord , that he did for Israel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord , died, being an hundred and ten years old.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and served Baalim:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And they forsook the Lord , and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord ; but they did not so.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

ow these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord , and forgat the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Lord delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord , the Lord raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.

nd the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord , when Ehud was dead.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the Lord gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Lord , when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The mountains melted from before the Lord , even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.

nd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord : and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]That the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And there came an angel of the Lord , and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord , Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord , and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

hen Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the Lord , and of Gideon.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the Lord , and of Gideon.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the Lord set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

nd the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Gideon said, Therefore when the Lord hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.

nd Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX](For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.

\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The Lord be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the Lord the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord , and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord 's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hands.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord , and I cannot go back.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord , do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then Manoah intreated the Lord , and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord , I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord . For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord , What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord : and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Samson called unto the Lord , and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the Lord , my son.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then said Micah, Now know I that the Lord will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

n those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the Lord is your way wherein ye go.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

nd it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the Lord ; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.

hen all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the Lord in Mizpeh.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX](Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Judah shall go up first.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX](And the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until even, and asked counsel of the Lord , saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the Lord said, Go up against him.)
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the Lord , and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel enquired of the Lord , (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the Lord said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the Lord smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the Lord ? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord ? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

ow it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

nd Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord bless thee.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord , who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.

hen Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, Blessed be thou of the Lord , my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the Lord liveth: lie down until the morning.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

hen went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord , which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

ow there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord , were there.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord , so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord , and wept sore.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord , that Eli marked her mouth.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord , and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord , and there abide for ever.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh: and the child was young.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord ; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord . And he worshipped the Lord there.

nd Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord , mine horn is exalted in the Lord : my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]There is none holy as the Lord : for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord 's, and he hath set the world upon them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord : for men abhorred the offering of the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But Samuel ministered before the Lord , being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord . And they went unto their own home.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the Lord 's people to transgress.

\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord , and also with men.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord , Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord , where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]That the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord , neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord ; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord . And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the Lord : let him do what seemeth him good.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord .

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpeh;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes, and by your thousands.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Therefore they enquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet come thither. And the Lord answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord . And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.

hen Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

nd Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Behold, here I am: witness against me before the Lord , and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord , which he did to you and to your fathers.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the Lord , then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when they forgat the Lord their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they cried unto the Lord , and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord , and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord your God was your king.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the Lord hath set a king over you.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]If ye will fear the Lord , and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord , then shall the hand of the Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the Lord will do before your eyes.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the Lord , and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the Lord , in asking you a king.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]So Samuel called unto the Lord ; and the Lord sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord , but serve the Lord with all your heart;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Only fear the Lord , and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.

aul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the Lord : I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

ow it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord 's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the Lord , in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And Saul built an altar unto the Lord : the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]For, as the Lord liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.

amuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord .
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the Lord : I have performed the commandment of the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord , but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord ?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord , and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord ? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord , he hath also rejected thee from being king.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord , and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord .
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord , and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord thy God.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord .
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

nd the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the Lord said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord : sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord 's anointed is before him.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the Lord is with him.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

ow the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy brethren;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]David said moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be with thee.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord 's, and he will give you into our hands.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

nd it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from Saul.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the Lord was with him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the Lord 's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The Lord do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the Lord , that I die not:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the Lord even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the Lord liveth.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the Lord hath sent thee away.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the Lord be between thee and me for ever.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord , saying, The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

hen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the Lord , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord ; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he enquired of the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord : because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the Lord 's priests.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Therefore David enquired of the Lord , saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then David enquired of the Lord yet again. And the Lord answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then said David, O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they two made a covenant before the Lord : and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord ; for ye have compassion on me.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.

nd it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord 's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord .
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord 's anointed.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The Lord therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.

nd Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]For in very deed, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the Lord , that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.

nd the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord 's anointed, and be guiltless?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]David said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the Lord liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the Lord 's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the Lord ; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord , saying, Go, serve other gods.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the Lord delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord 's anointed.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when Saul enquired of the Lord , the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Saul sware to her by the Lord , saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord , nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee this day.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the Lord liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And David enquired at the Lord , saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.

nd it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the Lord , saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the Lord , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And now the Lord shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

ow there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the Lord hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now then do it: for the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the Lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

hen came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord : and they anointed David king over Israel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And David went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And David perceived that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And David enquired of the Lord , saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And when David enquired of the Lord , he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So David would not remove the ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all his household.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And it was told king David, saying, The Lord hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David danced before the Lord with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord ; and she despised him in her heart.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they brought in the ark of the Lord , and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And David said unto Michal, It was before the Lord , which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord , over Israel: therefore will I play before the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the Lord is with thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord , Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then went king David in, and sat before the Lord , and he said, Who am I, O Lord God ? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God ; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord God ?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord God , knowest thy servant.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, Lord , art become their God.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And now, O Lord God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And now, O Lord God , thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord God , hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Which also king David did dedicate unto the Lord , with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord do that which seemeth him good.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord .

nd the Lord sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord , to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord . And Nathan said unto David, The Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Nathan departed unto his house. And the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the Lord , and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the Lord loved him.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the Lord .
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the Lord thy God will be with thee.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the Lord , in Hebron.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord , he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Lord , I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

nd when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord hath bidden him.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the Lord , and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

oreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the Lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

nd David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the Lord thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the Lord , if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord 's anointed?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

nd there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the Lord ?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

hen there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the Lord . And the Lord answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord ?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, whom the Lord did choose. And the king said, I will give them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the Lord 's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the Lord : and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

nd David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he said, The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I will call on the Lord , who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]In my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The Lord thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the Lord , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my stay.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]For thou art my lamp, O Lord : and the Lord will lighten my darkness.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For who is God, save the Lord ? and who is a rock, save our God?
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the Lord , but he answered them not.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord , among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

ow these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the Lord wrought a great victory.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said, Be it far from me, O Lord , that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.

nd again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Joab said unto the king, Now the Lord thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the Lord , I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O Lord , take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Go and say unto David, Thus saith the Lord , I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the Lord ; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the Lord commanded.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the Lord , that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And David built there an altar unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

ow king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the king sware, and said, As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the Lord God of my lord the king say so too.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And also thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

ow the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the Lord , saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the Lord .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then king Solomon sware by the Lord , saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Now therefore, as the Lord liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord ; that he might fulfil the word of the Lord , which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord , and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord ; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord , and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the Lord .
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the Lord , and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord , and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the Lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

nd Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord , and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord , until those days.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Solomon loved the Lord , walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the speech pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

nd Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

nd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the house which king Solomon built for the Lord , the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord .
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid, in the month Zif:
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

ut Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the Lord , and for the porch of the house.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the Lord :
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord , were of bright brass.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord : the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord . And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord .

hen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord , which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX](For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord , he arose from before the altar of the Lord , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]Blessed be the Lord , that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
\*[SUP]59\*[SUPX]And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord , be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
\*[SUP]60\*[SUPX]That all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God, and that there is none else.
\*[SUP]61\*[SUPX]Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
\*[SUP]62\*[SUPX]And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the Lord .
\*[SUP]63\*[SUPX]And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the Lord , two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]64\*[SUPX]The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the Lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
\*[SUP]65\*[SUPX]And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
\*[SUP]66\*[SUPX]On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.

nd it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord , and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]That the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and to this house?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the Lord , and the king's house,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX](Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the Lord , and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord , and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the Lord . So he finished the house.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

nd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord , she came to prove him with hard questions.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord ; there was no more spirit in her.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the Lord , and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

ut king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord , and went not fully after the Lord , as did David his father.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the Lord commanded.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX](For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX](But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

nd Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord , that he might perform his saying, which the Lord spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the Lord , and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

nd, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord , and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord ; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the Lord hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the Lord , and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For so was it charged me by the word of the Lord , saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For it was said to me by the word of the Lord , Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord , saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord , Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord , and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the Lord : therefore the Lord hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord , which he spake unto him.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

t that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the Lord hath spoken it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Moreover the Lord shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And it was so, when the king went into the house of the Lord , that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.

\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

ow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Nevertheless for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord , as did David his father.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the Lord all his days.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the Lord , silver, and gold, and vessels.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the Lord , which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger.

hen the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the Lord against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord , in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the Lord , which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord , in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord , and did worse than all that were before him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

nd Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord : for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord , which he spake by Elijah.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he cried unto the Lord , and said, O Lord my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord , and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.

nd it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord , that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord , how I hid an hundred men of the Lord 's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Elijah said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord , and thou hast followed Baalim.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord ; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord : and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord : and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Hear me, O Lord , hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord , he is the God; the Lord , he is the God.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

nd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord , take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord . And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord ; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

nd Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the Lord , Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the Lord , Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the Lord , Because the Syrians have said, The Lord is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the Lord , Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the Lord , behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord , Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

nd it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord , Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord , In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And of Jezebel also spake the Lord , saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord , whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord to day.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might enquire of him?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord : but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the Lord , With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the king's hand.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith unto me, that will I speak.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord ?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord , and said, I will persuade him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord : nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]And he did evil in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

hen Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Now therefore thus saith the Lord , Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord , Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord , Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

nd it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the Lord , I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord . And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

ow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord ; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord , that we may enquire of the Lord by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the Lord hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Elisha said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he said, Thus saith the Lord , Make this valley full of ditches.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord : he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

ow there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord : and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the mother of the child said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the Lord , They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord .

ow Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But he said, As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

nd the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord , I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord , and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Lord , open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he said, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord ; what should I wait for the Lord any longer?

hen Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord ; Thus saith the Lord , To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the Lord should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

hen spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the Lord hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the Lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the Lord .
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the Lord , as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

nd Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the Lord , I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord , even over Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord , at the hand of Jezebel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the Lord , I have anointed thee king over Israel.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lord laid this burden upon him;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the Lord ; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord . Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the Lord , which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

nd Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord , which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord . So they made him ride in his chariot.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the Lord , which he spake to Elijah.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord , but the worshippers of Baal only.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord , even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the Lord ,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord .

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the Lord 's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]This was the word of the Lord which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. And so it came to pass.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord : he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]In those days the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

n the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord his God, like David his father.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the Lord , from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the Lord , and put it on the north side of the altar.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the Lord for the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

n the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the Lord their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For they served idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Yet the Lord testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord their God.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that they should not do like them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they left all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord , and made them sin a great sin.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the Lord : therefore the Lord sent lions among them, which slew some of them.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord .
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]So they feared the Lord , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]They feared the Lord , and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the Lord , neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]With whom the Lord had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]But the Lord , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]But the Lord your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]So these nations feared the Lord , and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

ow it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father did.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For he clave to the Lord , and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord , and in the treasures of the king's house.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord , and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But if ye say unto me, We trust in the Lord our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Am I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying, The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The Lord will deliver us.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]It may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord , and said, O Lord God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Lord , bow down thine ear, and hear: open, Lord , thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Of a truth, Lord , the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God, even thou only.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord , and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

n those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord , Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]I beseech thee, O Lord , remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the Lord , the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third day?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the Lord , that the Lord will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord : and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , after the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he built altars in the house of the Lord , of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake by his servants the prophets, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as his father Manasseh did.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord .
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the Lord : and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the Lord , to repair the breaches of the house,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Go ye, enquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the Lord , thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord , when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the king went up into the house of the Lord , and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord , to walk after the Lord , and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord , without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord , where the women wove hangings for the grove.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the Lord , by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord , did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the Lord in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord , as the Lord had said.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the Lord , were keepers of the entry.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the Lord was with him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the Lord , namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the Lord , even against the word of the Lord , which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And enquired not of the Lord : therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord ; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So David waxed greater and greater: for the Lord of hosts was with him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the Lord saved them by a great deliverance.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the Lord .
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.

\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord , and to record, and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Give thanks unto the Lord , call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord .
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Sing unto the Lord , all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For all the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Give unto the Lord , ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The Lord reigneth.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord , because he cometh to judge the earth.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]O give thanks unto the Lord ; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord .
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon,
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]To offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord , which he commanded Israel;
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the Lord , because his mercy endureth for ever;
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the Lord , Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the Lord will build thee an house.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And David the king came and sat before the Lord , and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]O Lord , for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]O Lord , there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Lord , becamest their God.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Therefore now, Lord , let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And now, Lord , thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O Lord , and it shall be blessed for ever.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

ow it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the Lord do that which is good in his sight.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Joab answered, The Lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the Lord , I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord , Choose thee
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the Lord , even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the Lord ; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the Lord .
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the Lord : thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord , nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And David built there an altar unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the Lord ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the Lord commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord , to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord , from the age of twenty years and upward.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For David said, The Lord God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord , in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord , and likewise at even:
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the Lord in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the Lord :
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the Lord .

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Howbeit the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And of all my sons, (for the Lord hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the Lord , and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Take heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the Lord , and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the Lord .
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]All this, said David, the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord .

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord ?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the Lord , by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord : and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Thine, O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord , and thou art exalted as head above all.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the Lord your God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the Lord , and the king.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord , and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord , on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And did eat and drink before the Lord on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

nd Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the Lord : and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the Lord , which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Behold, I build an house to the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the Lord our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the Lord hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Huram said moreover, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the Lord , and an house for his kingdom.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the Lord of bright brass.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord ; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the Lord , saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord ;

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord , that he made with the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now then, O Lord God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.

ow when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord , because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord 's house.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord , saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord .
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the Lord , which David the king had made to praise the Lord , because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the Lord had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord , and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the Lord , and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the Lord hath come.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the Lord on the altar of the Lord , which he had built before the porch,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord , and until it was finished. So the house of the Lord was perfected.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord ; there was no more spirit in her.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the Lord , and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the Lord might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the Lord , and returned from going against Jeroboam.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the Lord :
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.

\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the Lord , Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The Lord is righteous.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And when the king entered into the house of the Lord , the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord .

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Have ye not cast out the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the Lord , are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they burn unto the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord our God; but ye have forsaken him.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the Lord , and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the Lord had given him rest.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the Lord our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord , it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the Lord , and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the Lord came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

nd the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the Lord , that was before the porch of the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they offered unto the Lord the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

n the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the Lord , he delivered them into thine hand.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the physicians.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Therefore the Lord stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord : moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the Lord to day.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might enquire of him?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the Lord : but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the Lord , With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou good.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the Lord ?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the Lord ; I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the Lord said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the Lord , and said, I will entice him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the Lord spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord , and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the Lord : even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord .
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord , before the new court,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And all Judah stood before the Lord , with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord , worshipping the Lord .
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord , and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord ; for his mercy endureth for ever.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.

\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord : therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Moreover the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

nd in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the Lord hath said of the sons of David.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But let none come into the house of the Lord , save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord .
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the Lord :
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the Lord 's people.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the Lord , to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord , as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord , that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the Lord : and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

oash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the Lord , and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Baalim.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord , and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the Lord , even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord ; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord , that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the Lord , he hath also forsaken you.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The Lord look upon it, and require it.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

maziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , but not with a perfect heart.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the Lord they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that his father Amaziah did.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the Lord , God made him to prosper.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the Lord , that were valiant men:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord , but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the Lord God.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord , from beside the incense altar.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the Lord had smitten him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord : and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

haz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord , like David his father:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Wherefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But a prophet of the Lord was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the Lord God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the Lord your God?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the Lord already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For the Lord brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord .
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord , and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord : this is that king Ahaz.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord , and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

ezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , according to all that David his father had done.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the Lord , and repaired them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord , and turned their backs.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]My sons, be not now negligent: for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the Lord , to cleanse the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord , to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord . And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord : so they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the Lord , and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the Lord .
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the Lord by his prophets.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the Lord , come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the Lord . And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord .
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the Lord was set in order.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

nd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the Lord , and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For if ye turn again unto the Lord , your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good Lord pardon every one
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]That prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the Lord : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the Lord God of their fathers.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.

ow when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the Lord .
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord .
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord their God, and laid them by heaps.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the Lord , and his people Israel.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord , we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the Lord hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord ; and they prepared them,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the Lord , and the most holy things.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the Lord , his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the Lord his God.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

fter these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And his servants spake yet more against the Lord God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]He wrote also letters to rail on the Lord God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the Lord sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And many brought gifts unto the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the Lord : and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]But did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Also he built altars in the house of the Lord , whereof the Lord had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the Lord , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord , and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he repaired the altar of the Lord , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the Lord their God only.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord , as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And humbled not himself before the Lord , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

osiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord , and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Lord , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the Lord , to repair and amend the house:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord . And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord , to do after all that is written in this book.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And she answered them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the Lord , so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the king went up into the house of the Lord , and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the Lord , to walk after the Lord , and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all his days they departed not from following the Lord , the God of their fathers.

oreover Josiah kept a passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the Lord ,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the Lord , Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the Lord your God, and his people Israel,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the Lord , as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord , according to the commandment of king Josiah.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the Lord ,
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord , and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]To fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord ; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord , because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the Lord ; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the Lord God of your fathers.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the Lord .

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]O Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children.

he words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And said, I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]O Lord , I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

nd it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

ut it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord , which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.

nd there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the Lord . And the people did according to this promise.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.

ow it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

\*[SUP]61\*[SUPX]And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.
\*[SUP]62\*[SUPX]The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
\*[SUP]63\*[SUPX]And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.
\*[SUP]64\*[SUPX]These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
\*[SUP]65\*[SUPX]And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
\*[SUP]66\*[SUPX]The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
\*[SUP]67\*[SUPX]Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.
\*[SUP]68\*[SUPX]Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five:
\*[SUP]69\*[SUPX]Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
\*[SUP]70\*[SUPX]And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
\*[SUP]71\*[SUPX]And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver.
\*[SUP]72\*[SUPX]And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments.
\*[SUP]73\*[SUPX]So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

nd all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Ezra blessed the Lord , the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord with their faces to the ground.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord : neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.

ow in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the Lord their God.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the Lord their God.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the Lord your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.

n that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

ow it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.

fter these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

fter these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.

ow it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

ow in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord , and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord .

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?

herefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.

hen Job answered the Lord , and said,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted Job.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He had also seven sons and three daughters.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So Job died, being old and full of days.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]I will call upon the Lord , who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]In my distress I called upon the Lord , and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my stay.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For I have kept the ways of the Lord , and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For who is God save the Lord ? or who is a rock save our God?
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Lord , but he answered them not.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.

ive ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord , and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
\*[SUP]59\*[SUPX]When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
\*[SUP]60\*[SUPX]So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
\*[SUP]61\*[SUPX]And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
\*[SUP]62\*[SUPX]He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
\*[SUP]63\*[SUPX]The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
\*[SUP]64\*[SUPX]Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
\*[SUP]65\*[SUPX]Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
\*[SUP]66\*[SUPX]And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
\*[SUP]67\*[SUPX]Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
\*[SUP]68\*[SUPX]But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
\*[SUP]69\*[SUPX]And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
\*[SUP]70\*[SUPX]He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
\*[SUP]71\*[SUPX]From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\*[SUP]72\*[SUPX]So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord .
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]These see the works of the Lord , and his wonders in the deep.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord , and find the knowledge of God.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For the froward is abomination to the Lord : but his secret is with the righteous.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Open rebuke is better than secret love.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.

he words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

he vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Hear the word of the Lord , ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord : I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord : though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Therefore saith the Lord , the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]In mine ears said the Lord of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the Lord , neither consider the operation of his hands.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.

nd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then said the Lord unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God , It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Moreover the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Wherefore hear the word of the Lord , ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.

ow it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But if thou say to me, We trust in the Lord our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And am I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it? the Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord , saying, The Lord will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the Lord will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the Lord , Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Incline thine ear, O Lord , and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord , and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Of a truth, Lord , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord , even thou only.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]This is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]I said, I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord , in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord , I am oppressed; undertake for me.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

omfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the Lord 's hand double for all her sins.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord , or being his counsellor hath taught him?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord , and my judgment is passed over from my God?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord , the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

eep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the Lord , the first, and with the last; I am he.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the Lord , and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.

\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

ehold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Thus saith God the Lord , he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]I am the Lord : that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Let them give glory unto the Lord , and declare his praise in the islands.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord 's servant?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the Lord , he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord , and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]I, even I, am the Lord ; and beside me there is no saviour.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord , that I am God.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]I am the Lord , your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord ; and there is none else.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord God , and his Spirit, hath sent me.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the Lord , and my work with my God.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And now, saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord , and my God shall be my strength.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God , Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord : for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

ehold, the Lord 's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]In transgressing and lying against the Lord , and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord , and their offspring with them.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord .

hus saith the Lord , The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord : but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Hear the word of the Lord , ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord : shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord , as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord , so shall your seed and your name remain.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

he words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then said I, Ah, Lord God ! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord ; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord , to deliver thee.

oreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord ; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Israel was holiness unto the Lord , and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Hear ye the word of the Lord , O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Neither said they, Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The priests said not, Where is the Lord ? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord , and with your children's children will I plead.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]O generation, see ye the word of the Lord . Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.

hey say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord ; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord , and I will not keep anger for ever.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord ; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the Lord , they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord : neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord ; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord , to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the Lord their God.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.

f thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord , return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Circumcise yourselves to the Lord , and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned back from us.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then said I, Ah, Lord God ! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord , and by his fierce anger.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the Lord : it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord , I will not make a full end with you.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the Lord our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your's.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Fear ye not me? saith the Lord : will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?

 ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For thus hath the Lord of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord ; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord , The temple of the Lord , The temple of the Lord , are these.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord , and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Do they provoke me to anger? saith the Lord : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the Lord : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the Lord of hosts.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord .

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord ; and what wisdom is in them?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I will surely consume them, saith the Lord : there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the Lord our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the Lord : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the Lord saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Yet hear the word of the Lord , O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord ; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is his name.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord : therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]O Lord , correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The Lord called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For the Lord of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the Lord hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But, O Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord , that thou die not by our hand:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

ighteous art thou, O Lord , when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But thou, O Lord , knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The Lord liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.

hus saith the Lord unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]So I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord , and put it on my loins.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the Lord ; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the Lord : I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the Lord hath spoken.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the Lord 's flock is carried away captive.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the Lord ; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?

he word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]O Lord , though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Lord , art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the Lord doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then said the Lord unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then said I, Ah, Lord God ! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]We acknowledge, O Lord , our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.

hen said the Lord unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the Lord ; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the Lord : the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord , thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The Lord said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]O Lord , thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord .

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the Lord , and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord , and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]O Lord , my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the Lord , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Give heed to me, O Lord , and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Yet, Lord , thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.

hus saith the Lord , Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And say, Hear ye the word of the Lord , O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Thus will I do unto this place, saith the Lord , and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord 's house; and said to all the people,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.

ow Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the Lord , heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The Lord hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]O Lord , thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But, O Lord of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Sing unto the Lord , praise ye the Lord : for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And let that man be as the cities which the Lord overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.

he word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Enquire, I pray thee, of the Lord for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the Lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And afterward, saith the Lord , I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the Lord ;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]O house of David, thus saith the Lord ; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the Lord , that this house shall become a desolation.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]As I live, saith the Lord , though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the Lord .

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness .

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But, The Lord liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the Lord , and because of the words of his holiness.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord , and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The anger of the Lord shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord , and not a God afar off?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord . Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord , that steal my words every one from his neighbour.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord , that use their tongues, and say, He saith.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord , and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the Lord ? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the Lord , I will even punish that man and his house.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the Lord answered? and, What hath the Lord spoken?

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord ; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord , for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,

\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the Lord .
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; Stand in the court of the Lord 's house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the Lord 's house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord ; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord , saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the Lord , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God; and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the Lord , and besought the Lord , and the Lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the Lord , with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the Lord ; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For I have not sent them, saith the Lord , yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the Lord ; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord 's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But if they be prophets, and if the word of the Lord be with them, let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Yea, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord , and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the Lord ; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.

nd it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the Lord , in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord 's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the Lord : for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord ,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the Lord do so: the Lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the Lord 's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the Lord ; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord ; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The Lord hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord .

ow these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX](After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord , That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord , thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I will be found of you, saith the Lord : and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the Lord ; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Because ye have said, The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Know that thus saith the Lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord , which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord , all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the Lord ; because he hath taught rebellion against the Lord .

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus speaketh the Lord God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For, lo, the days come, saith the Lord , that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the Lord : and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And these are the words that the Lord spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord ; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the Lord ; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For I am with thee, saith the Lord , to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord , Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord ; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.

\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord .

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The Lord bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord :
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord , I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord : for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord : for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is his name:
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the Lord ; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the Lord : though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord , and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Ah Lord God ! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the Lord of hosts, is his name,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And thou hast said unto me, O Lord God , Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Behold, I am the Lord , the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And now therefore thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord ; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the Lord .

oreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord the maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, to establish it; the Lord is his name;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts: for the Lord is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord . For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our righteousness.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Moreover the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the Lord hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

he word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Yet hear the word of the Lord , O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the Lord of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord , to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Behold, I will command, saith the Lord , and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the Lord , into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I brought them into the house of the Lord , into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.

nd it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord , saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord , which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the Lord :
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the ears of the people in the Lord 's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]It may be they will present their supplication before the Lord , and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the Lord hath pronounced against this people.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord 's house.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the Lord 's house, in the ears of all the people.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord ,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the Lord hid them.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the Lord ; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the Lord , which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the Lord our God for us.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the Lord ? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

hen Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord : and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the Lord liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord , the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord , which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Now the Lord hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the Lord , and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord , to dwell in the land of Judah.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord : thus came they even to Tahpanhes.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore now thus saith the Lord , the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord , we will not hearken unto thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the Lord remember them, and came it not into his mind?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the Lord , and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord , nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the Lord , all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord , all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord , that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord God liveth.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the Lord , that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For this is the day of the Lord God of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The word that the Lord spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the Lord did drive them.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]As I live, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord , though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the Lord : for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the Lord hath spoken.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the Lord : Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]I know his wrath, saith the Lord ; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the Lord , him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord ; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the Lord .
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the Lord .

\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the Lord ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the Lord , which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the Lord ; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the Lord .

he word that the Lord spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord , the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the Lord their God.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the Lord , the habitation of justice, even the Lord , the hope of their fathers.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the Lord : take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the Lord , and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his temple.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the Lord , against the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord , and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the Lord ; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord , that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.

hus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord 's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord 's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord , the vengeance of his temple.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the Lord , which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord .
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the Lord 's house.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]Because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the Lord God of recompences shall surely requite.
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.
\*[SUP]59\*[SUPX]The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.
\*[SUP]60\*[SUPX]So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.
\*[SUP]61\*[SUPX]And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;
\*[SUP]62\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou say, O Lord , thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
\*[SUP]63\*[SUPX]And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:
\*[SUP]64\*[SUPX]And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

edekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And burned the house of the Lord , and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord : the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

ow doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O Lord , behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O Lord , and consider; for I am become vile.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the Lord hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Behold, O Lord ; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

ow hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the Lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord , as in the day of a solemn feast.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]The Lord hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Behold, O Lord , and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the Lord 's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The Lord hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The anger of the Lord hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.

ow it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]The word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord . And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God ; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And ye shall know that I am the Lord : for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord God ! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the Lord : unto us is this land given in possession.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God ; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God ; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the Lord had shewed me.

he word of the Lord also came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And in the morning came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord God of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord God ; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]For I am the Lord : I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the Lord ;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord .
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The Lord saith: and the Lord hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The Lord saith it; albeit I have not spoken?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord God .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And say, Thus saith the Lord God ; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Wherefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God ; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the Lord will answer him by myself:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord God .

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord God ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.

gain the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And say, Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God , and thou becamest mine.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord God ;)
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord God , seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord :
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord God : and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]As I live, saith the Lord God , Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\*[SUP]50\*[SUPX]And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.
\*[SUP]51\*[SUPX]Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.
\*[SUP]52\*[SUPX]Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
\*[SUP]53\*[SUPX]When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
\*[SUP]54\*[SUPX]That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
\*[SUP]55\*[SUPX]When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
\*[SUP]56\*[SUPX]For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
\*[SUP]57\*[SUPX]Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.
\*[SUP]58\*[SUPX]Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]59\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord God ; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
\*[SUP]60\*[SUPX]Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
\*[SUP]61\*[SUPX]Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
\*[SUP]62\*[SUPX]And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord :
\*[SUP]63\*[SUPX]That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God .

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Say thou, Thus saith the Lord God ; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]As I live, saith the Lord God , surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord have spoken and have done it.

he word of the Lord came unto me again, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]As I live, saith the Lord God , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God : and not that he should return from his ways, and live?
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord God . Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God : wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

nd it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the Lord , and sat before me.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord God , I will not be enquired of by you.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord your God;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]I am the Lord your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God ; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord God , I will not be enquired of by you.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]As I live, saith the Lord God , surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God ; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord God , there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord ; Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And all flesh shall see that I the Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord ; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the Lord have said it.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.

\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the Lord have poured out my fury upon you.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord God , when the Lord hath not spoken.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord God .

he word of the Lord came again unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]The Lord said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord God ; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord God .

gain in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Wherefore thus saith the Lord God ; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I the Lord have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Also the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then I answered them, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord God .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord .

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God ; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And say, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord , when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord God .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the Lord : because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Yet thus saith the Lord God ; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord God .

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the Lord .

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord God .

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.

\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then shall they know that I am the Lord , when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord ;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]As I live, saith the Lord God , surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord ;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the Lord , when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God .

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God , I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the Lord was there:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God , I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And thou shalt know that I am the Lord , and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the Lord .

lso, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord :
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord God ; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God ; Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the Lord , and are gone forth out of his land.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God ; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord , saith the Lord God , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God , be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord .

he hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord , and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God , thou knowest.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord .
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God ; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them?

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord God ; this is the day whereof I have spoken.

\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God ; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]So the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God .

n the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me thither.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures;
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the Lord to minister unto him.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

fterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the Lord .
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

hen he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord God ; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord God , a young bullock for a sin offering.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And thou shalt offer them before the Lord , and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord God .

hen he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord , the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord : and I fell upon my face.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord , and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God ; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord God , and they shall bear their iniquity.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God :
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.

\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord God .
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the Lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the Lord , one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the Lord of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the Lord .
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

fterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord God ; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.

\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

n the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

nd in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
\*[SUP]46\*[SUPX]Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
\*[SUP]47\*[SUPX]The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.
\*[SUP]48\*[SUPX]Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
\*[SUP]49\*[SUPX]Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

ebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.

ebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

elshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And this is the writing that was written, Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin .
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]This is the interpretation of the thing: Mene ; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]Tekel ; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Peres ; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

t pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.

\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

n the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.

n the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]O Lord , righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]O Lord , according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God;
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

n the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.

lso I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
\*[SUP]33\*[SUPX]And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.
\*[SUP]34\*[SUPX]Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
\*[SUP]35\*[SUPX]And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.
\*[SUP]36\*[SUPX]And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.
\*[SUP]37\*[SUPX]Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.
\*[SUP]38\*[SUPX]But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
\*[SUP]39\*[SUPX]Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
\*[SUP]40\*[SUPX]And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
\*[SUP]41\*[SUPX]He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
\*[SUP]42\*[SUPX]He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
\*[SUP]43\*[SUPX]But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
\*[SUP]44\*[SUPX]But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.
\*[SUP]45\*[SUPX]And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

he word of the Lord that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]The beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea. And the Lord said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord , that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord .
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord , I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the Lord .
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.

he word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord ; the priests, the Lord 's ministers, mourn.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God, and cry unto the Lord ,
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]O Lord , to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Therefore also now, saith the Lord , turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord , weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord , and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Yea, the Lord will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord will do great things.
\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.
\*[SUP]24\*[SUPX]And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
\*[SUP]25\*[SUPX]And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
\*[SUP]26\*[SUPX]And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\*[SUP]27\*[SUPX]And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.
\*[SUP]28\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
\*[SUP]29\*[SUPX]And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
\*[SUP]30\*[SUPX]And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
\*[SUP]31\*[SUPX]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.
\*[SUP]32\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.

\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the Lord , and shall water the valley of Shittim.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:

\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord .

\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.

 prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]O Lord , I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O Lord , revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Yet I will rejoice in the Lord , I will joy in the God of my salvation.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the Lord , and that swear by Malcham;
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And them that are turned back from the Lord ; and those that have not sought the Lord , nor enquired for him.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God : for the day of the Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord 's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord , that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord : and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord 's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the Lord 's house should be built.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Then came the word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the Lord .
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then spake Haggai the Lord 's messenger in the Lord 's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord .

\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?

\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord ; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord :
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the Lord 's temple was laid, consider it.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

\*[SUP]22\*[SUPX]And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
\*[SUP]23\*[SUPX]In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord , and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.

\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord ; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts the holy mountain.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.

\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]For thus saith the Lord of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord of hosts, and I repented not:
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord .

\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\*[SUP]19\*[SUPX]This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\*[SUP]20\*[SUPX]In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, Holiness Unto The Lord ; and the pots in the Lord 's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
\*[SUP]21\*[SUPX]Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts.

he burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]I have loved you, saith the Lord . Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord : yet I loved Jacob,
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord will be magnified from the border of Israel.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the Lord .
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.

nd now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]The Lord will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]For the Lord , the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the Lord of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]Ye have wearied the Lord with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord , and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

ehold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord , whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord , as in the days of old, and as in former years.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]For I am the Lord , I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.
\*[SUP]7\*[SUPX]Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?
\*[SUP]8\*[SUPX]Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
\*[SUP]9\*[SUPX]Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.
\*[SUP]10\*[SUPX]Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
\*[SUP]11\*[SUPX]And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]12\*[SUPX]And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]13\*[SUPX]Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord . Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?
\*[SUP]14\*[SUPX]Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?
\*[SUP]15\*[SUPX]And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.
\*[SUP]16\*[SUPX]Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord , and that thought upon his name.
\*[SUP]17\*[SUPX]And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
\*[SUP]18\*[SUPX]Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.

or, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
\*[SUP]2\*[SUPX]But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
\*[SUP]3\*[SUPX]And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.
\*[SUP]4\*[SUPX]Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.
\*[SUP]5\*[SUPX]Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord :
\*[SUP]6\*[SUPX]And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
