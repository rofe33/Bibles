n the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
\[2]And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
\[3]And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
\[4]And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
\[5]And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
\[6]And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
\[7]And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
\[8]And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
\[9]And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
\[10]And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
\[11]And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
\[12]And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\[13]And the evening and the morning were the third day.
\[14]And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
\[15]And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
\[16]And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
\[17]And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
\[18]And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
\[19]And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
\[20]And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
\[21]And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\[22]And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
\[23]And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
\[24]And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
\[25]And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
\[26]And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.
\[27]So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
\[28]And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.
\[29]And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
\[30]And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.
\[31]And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

hus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
\[2]And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
\[3]And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
\[4]These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
\[5]And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
\[6]But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
\[7]And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
\[8]And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
\[9]And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
\[10]And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
\[11]The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
\[12]And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
\[13]And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.
\[14]And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
\[15]And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
\[16]And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:
\[17]But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.
\[18]And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an associated helper for him.
\[19]And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
\[20]And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an associated helper for him.
\[21]And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
\[22]And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
\[23]And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
\[24]Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
\[25]And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

ow the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, has God said, All of you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
\[2]And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
\[3]But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, All of you shall not eat of it, neither shall all of you touch it, lest all of you die.
\[4]And the serpent said unto the woman, All of you shall not surely die:
\[5]For God does know that in the day all of you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and all of you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
\[6]And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
\[7]And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
\[8]And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
\[9]And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where are you?
\[10]And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
\[11]And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded you that you should not eat?
\[12]And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
\[13]And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent misled me, and I did eat.
\[14]And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon your belly shall you go, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life:
\[15]And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.
\[16]Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.
\[17]And unto Adam he said, Because you have hearkened unto the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life;
\[18]Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you; and you shall eat the herb of the field;
\[19]In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, till you return unto the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and unto dust shall you return.
\[20]And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
\[21]Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
\[22]And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
\[23]Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
\[24]So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

\[2]And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
\[3]And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
\[4]And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
\[5]But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
\[6]And the LORD said unto Cain, Why are you angry? and why is your countenance fallen?
\[7]If you do well, shall you not be accepted? and if you do not well, sin lies at the door. And unto you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him.
\[8]And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
\[9]And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
\[10]And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries unto me from the ground.
\[11]And now are you cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;
\[12]When you till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto you her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shall you be in the earth.
\[13]And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\[14]Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.
\[15]And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
\[16]And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
\[17]And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
\[18]And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad brings forth Mehujael: and Mehujael brings forth Methusael: and Methusael brings forth Lamech.
\[19]And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
\[20]And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
\[21]And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
\[22]And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
\[23]And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; all of you wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
\[24]If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
\[25]And Adam had sexual contact with his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
\[26]And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

\[3]And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
\[4]There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
\[5]And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

\[9]These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

\[15]And this is the fashion which you shall make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
\[16]A window shall you make to the ark, and in a cubit shall you finish it above; and the door of the ark shall you set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shall you make it.
\[17]And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
\[18]But with you will I establish my covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
\[19]And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall you bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
\[20]Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto you, to keep them alive.

\[18]And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
\[19]And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
\[20]Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
\[21]And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, and every man:
\[22]All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.

\[20]And Noah began to be an farmer, and he planted a vineyard:
\[21]And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
\[22]And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
\[23]And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
\[24]And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
\[25]And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
\[26]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
\[27]God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

\[8]And Cush brings forth Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
\[9]He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
\[10]And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
\[11]Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
\[12]And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

\[3]And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen had they for mortar.
\[4]And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
\[5]And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.
\[6]And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
\[7]Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
\[8]So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
\[9]Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

\[25]And Nahor lived after he brings forth Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and brings forth sons and daughters.
\[26]And Terah lived seventy years, and brings forth Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
\[27]Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah brings forth Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran brings forth Lot.
\[28]And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
\[29]And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
\[30]But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
\[31]And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

\[3]And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.

\[5]And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had got in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
\[6]And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
\[7]And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
\[8]And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
\[9]And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
\[10]And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look upon:
\[12]Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see you, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive.
\[13]Say, I pray you, you are my sister: that it may be well with me for your sake; and my soul shall live because of you.
\[14]And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
\[15]The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
\[16]And he pleaded Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and male servants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
\[17]And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
\[18]And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that you have done unto me? why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
\[19]Why said you, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold your wife, take her, and go your way.

\[3]And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
\[4]Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
\[5]And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
\[6]And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
\[7]And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
\[8]And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen; for we be brethren.
\[9]Is not the whole land before you? separate yourself, I pray you, from me: if you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
\[10]And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you come unto Zoar.
\[11]Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
\[12]Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
\[13]But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
\[14]And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now yours eyes, and look from the place where you are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
\[15]For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed for ever.
\[16]And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered.
\[17]Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto you.
\[18]Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

\[8]And I will give unto you, and to your seed after you, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

\[13]He that is born in your house, and he that is bought with your money, must essentially be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
\[14]And the uncircumcised male child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.

\[19]For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.

\[21]I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which has come unto me; and if not, I will know.
\[22]And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
\[23]And Abraham drew near, and said, Will you also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
\[24]Possibly there be fifty righteous within the city: will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
\[25]That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

\[27]And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:
\[28]Possibly there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: will you destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
\[29]And he spoke unto him yet again, and said, Possibly there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
\[30]And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Possibly there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
\[31]And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Possibly there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
\[32]And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Possibly ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
\[33]And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

nd there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
\[2]And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and all of you shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
\[3]And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
\[4]But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
\[5]And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to you this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
\[6]And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
\[7]And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
\[8]Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do all of you to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
\[9]And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will essentially be a judge: now will we deal worse with you, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
\[10]But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
\[11]And they stroke the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
\[12]And the men said unto Lot, Have you here any besides? son in law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whatsoever you have in the city, bring them out of this place:
\[13]For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is becoming great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.
\[14]And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
\[15]And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife, and your two daughters, which are here; lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
\[16]And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
\[17]And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither stay you in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you be consumed.
\[18]And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:
\[19]Behold now, your servant has found grace in your sight, and you have magnified your mercy, which you have showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
\[20]Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
\[21]And he said unto him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.
\[22]Haste you, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till you be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
\[23]The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
\[24]Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
\[25]And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
\[26]But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
\[27]And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
\[28]And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
\[29]And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
\[30]And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
\[31]And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
\[32]Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\[33]And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[34]And it came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go you in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
\[35]And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
\[36]Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
\[37]And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
\[38]And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

nd Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
\[2]And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
\[3]But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you are but a dead man, for the woman which you have taken; for she is a man's wife.
\[4]But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, will you slay also a righteous nation?
\[5]Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands have I done this.
\[6]And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; for I also withheld you from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you not to touch her.
\[7]Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live: and if you restore her not, know you that you shall surely die, you, and all that are yours.
\[8]Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
\[9]Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What have you done unto us? and what have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? you have done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
\[10]And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What saw you, that you have done this thing?
\[11]And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
\[12]And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
\[13]And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is your kindness which you shall show unto me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
\[14]And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and male servants, and female servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
\[15]And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you: dwell where it pleases you.
\[16]And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to you a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with you, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
\[17]So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
\[18]For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

nd the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
\[2]For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
\[3]And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
\[4]And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
\[5]And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
\[6]And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
\[7]And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.
\[8]And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
\[9]And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
\[10]Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
\[11]And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
\[12]And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your bondwoman; in all that Sarah has said unto you, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall your seed be called.
\[13]And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is your seed.
\[14]And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
\[15]And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
\[16]And she went, and sat her down opposite to him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat opposite to him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
\[17]And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What disturbs you, Hagar? fear not; for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
\[18]Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in yours hand; for I will make him a great nation.
\[19]And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
\[20]And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
\[21]And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do:
\[23]Now therefore swear unto me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto you, you shall do unto me, and to the land wherein you have sojourned.
\[24]And Abraham said, I will swear.
\[25]And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
\[26]And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing; neither did you tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.
\[27]And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
\[28]And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
\[29]And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?
\[30]And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shall you take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have dug this well.
\[31]Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them.
\[32]Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
\[33]And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
\[34]And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

\[2]And he said, Take now your son, yours only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell you of.
\[3]And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
\[4]Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.
\[5]And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide all of you here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
\[6]And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
\[7]And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
\[8]And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
\[9]And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
\[10]And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
\[11]And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
\[12]And he said, Lay not yours hand upon the lad, neither do you any thing unto him: for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, yours only son from me.
\[13]And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the position of his son.
\[14]And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.
\[15]And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
\[16]And said, By myself have I sworn, says the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, yours only son:
\[17]That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
\[18]And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed my voice.
\[19]So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
\[20]And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she has also born children unto your brother Nahor;
\[21]Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
\[22]And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
\[23]And Bethuel brings forth Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

\[3]And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,
\[4]I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
\[5]And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
\[6]Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury your dead; none of us shall withhold from you his tomb, but that you may bury your dead.
\[7]And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
\[8]And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and implore for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
\[9]That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace among you.
\[10]And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
\[11]Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.
\[12]And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
\[13]And he spoke unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will give it, I pray you, hear me: I will give you money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
\[14]And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
\[15]My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and you? bury therefore your dead.
\[16]And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
\[17]And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
\[18]Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
\[19]And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

nd Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
\[2]And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:
\[3]And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
\[4]But you shall go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
\[5]And the servant said unto him, Possibly the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I essentially bring your son again unto the land from whence you came?
\[6]And Abraham said unto him, Beware you that you bring not my son thither again.
\[7]The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spoke unto me, and that swore unto me, saying, Unto your seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife unto my son from thence.
\[8]And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
\[9]And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
\[10]And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
\[11]And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
\[12]And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray you, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.
\[13]Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
\[14]And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: let the same be she that you have appointed for your servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that you have showed kindness unto my master.
\[15]And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
\[16]And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
\[17]And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray you, drink a little water of your pitcher.
\[18]And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
\[19]And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have done drinking.
\[20]And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the gutter, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
\[21]And the man wondering at her held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
\[22]And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
\[23]And said, Whose daughter are you? tell me, I pray you: is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?
\[24]And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
\[25]She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and animal food enough, and room to lodge in.
\[26]And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
\[27]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
\[28]And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
\[29]And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
\[30]And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
\[31]And he said, Come in, you blessed of the LORD; wherefore stand you without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
\[32]And the man came into the house: and he unbounded his camels, and gave straw and animal food for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
\[33]And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
\[34]And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
\[35]And the LORD has blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he has given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and male servants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
\[36]And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him has he given all that he has.
\[37]And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
\[38]But you shall go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
\[39]And I said unto my master, Possibly the woman will not follow me.
\[40]And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
\[41]Then shall you be clear from this my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they give not you one, you shall be clear from my oath.
\[42]And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go:
\[43]Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water of your pitcher to drink;
\[44]And she say to me, Both drink you, and I will also draw for your camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD has appointed out for my master's son.
\[45]And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray you.
\[46]And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
\[47]And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
\[48]And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
\[49]And now if all of you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
\[50]Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD: we cannot speak unto you bad or good.
\[51]Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the LORD has spoken.
\[52]And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.
\[53]And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
\[54]And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
\[55]And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
\[56]And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD has prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
\[57]And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
\[58]And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.
\[59]And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
\[60]And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, You are our sister, be you the mother of thousands of millions, and let your seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
\[61]And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
\[62]And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
\[63]And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
\[64]And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
\[65]For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
\[66]And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
\[67]And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

hen again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
\[2]And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
\[3]And Jokshan brings forth Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
\[4]And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
\[5]And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
\[6]But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
\[7]And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
\[8]Then Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
\[9]And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
\[10]The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
\[11]And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.
\[12]Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
\[13]And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
\[14]And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
\[15]Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
\[16]These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
\[17]And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the spirit and died; and was gathered unto his people.
\[18]And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
\[19]And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham brings forth Isaac:
\[20]And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
\[21]And Isaac implored the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was implored of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
\[22]And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
\[23]And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
\[24]And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
\[25]And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
\[26]And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
\[27]And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
\[28]And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
\[29]And Jacob cook pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
\[30]And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
\[31]And Jacob said, Sell me this day your birthright.
\[32]And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
\[33]And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
\[34]Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.

nd there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
\[2]And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:
\[3]Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for unto you, and unto your seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham your father;
\[4]And I will make your seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto your seed all these countries; and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
\[5]Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
\[6]And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
\[7]And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
\[8]And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
\[9]And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, certainly she is your wife; and how said you, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
\[10]And Abimelech said, What is this you have done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with your wife, and you should have brought guiltiness upon us.
\[11]And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
\[12]Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
\[13]And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
\[14]For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
\[15]For all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
\[16]And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for you are much mightier than we.
\[17]And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
\[18]And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
\[19]And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
\[20]And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
\[21]And they dug another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
\[22]And he removed from thence, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
\[23]And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
\[24]And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father: fear not, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
\[25]And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dug a well.
\[26]Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
\[27]And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come all of you to me, seeing all of you hate me, and have sent me away from you?
\[28]And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;
\[29]That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done unto you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD.
\[30]And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
\[31]And they rose up early in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
\[32]And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said unto him, We have found water.
\[33]And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.
\[34]And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
\[35]Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

nd it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.
\[2]And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
\[3]Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
\[4]And make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you before I die.
\[5]And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
\[6]And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak unto Esau your brother, saying,
\[7]Bring me venison, and make me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.
\[8]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.
\[9]Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury food for your father, such as he loves:
\[10]And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death.
\[11]And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
\[12]My father possibly will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
\[13]And his mother said unto him, Upon me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
\[14]And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved.
\[15]And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
\[16]And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
\[17]And she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
\[18]And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are you, my son?
\[19]And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau your first born; I have done according as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.
\[20]And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought it to me.
\[21]And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not.
\[22]And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
\[23]And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
\[24]And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
\[25]And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.
\[26]And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
\[27]And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:
\[28]Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
\[29]Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brethren, and let your mother's sons bow down to you: cursed be every one that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you.
\[30]And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
\[31]And he also had made savoury food, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me.
\[32]And Isaac his father said unto him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn Esau.
\[33]And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
\[34]And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
\[35]And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.
\[36]And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?
\[37]And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto you, my son?
\[38]And Esau said unto his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[39]And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
\[40]And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.
\[41]And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
\[42]And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, your brother Esau, as concerning you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you.
\[43]Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;
\[44]And tarry with him a few days, until your brother's fury turn away;
\[45]Until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forget that which you have done to him: then I will send, and fetch you from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
\[46]And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

\[2]Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
\[3]And God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a multitude of people;
\[4]And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you; that you may inherit the land wherein you are a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
\[5]And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
\[6]When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
\[7]And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;
\[8]And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
\[9]Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
\[10]And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
\[11]And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
\[12]And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
\[13]And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed;
\[14]And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\[15]And, behold, I am with you, and will keep you in all places where you go, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken to you of.
\[16]And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
\[17]And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is no other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
\[18]And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
\[19]And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
\[20]And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
\[21]So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
\[22]And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto you.

\[3]And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
\[4]And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be all of you? And they said, Of Haran are we.
\[5]And he said unto them, Know all of you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
\[6]And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.
\[7]And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water all of you the sheep, and go and feed them.
\[8]And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
\[9]And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.
\[10]And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
\[11]And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[12]And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
\[13]And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
\[14]And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.

\[16]And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
\[17]Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
\[18]And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.
\[19]And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
\[20]And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
\[21]And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
\[22]And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
\[23]And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
\[24]And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
\[25]And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this you have done unto me? did not I serve with you for Rachel? wherefore then have you misled me?
\[26]And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
\[27]Fulfill her week, and we will give you this also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years.
\[28]And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
\[29]And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
\[30]And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
\[31]And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
\[32]And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
\[33]And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard I was hated, he has therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
\[34]And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

\[16]And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in unto me; for surely I have hired you with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
\[17]And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.

\[24]And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.
\[25]And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
\[26]Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service which I have done you.
\[27]And Laban said unto him, I pray you, if I have found favour in yours eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake.
\[28]And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.
\[29]And he said unto him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle was with me.
\[30]For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
\[31]And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me any thing: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock.
\[32]I will pass through all your flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
\[33]So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
\[34]And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to your word.
\[35]And he removed that day the he goats that were striped with bands and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
\[36]And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
\[37]And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and stripped white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
\[38]And he set the rods which he had stripped before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
\[39]And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle striped with bands, speckled, and spotted.
\[40]And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped with bands, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
\[41]And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
\[42]But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
\[43]And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and male servants, and camels, and asses.

nd he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's has he got all this glory.
\[2]And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
\[3]And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of your fathers, and to your kindred; and I will be with you.
\[4]And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
\[5]And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
\[6]And all of you know that with all my power I have served your father.
\[7]And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
\[8]If he said thus, The speckled shall be your wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The striped with bands shall be your hire; then bare all the cattle striped with bands.
\[9]Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
\[10]And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were striped with bands, speckled, and greyed.
\[11]And the angel of God spoke unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
\[12]And he said, Lift up now yours eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are striped with bands, speckled, and greyed: for I have seen all that Laban does unto you.
\[13]I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow unto me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return unto the land of your kindred.
\[14]And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
\[15]Are we not counted of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has quite devoured also our money.
\[16]For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God has said unto you, do.
\[17]Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
\[18]And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had got, the cattle of his getting, which he had got in Padanaram, in order to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
\[19]And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
\[20]And Jacob stole away unexpectedly to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
\[21]So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
\[22]And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
\[23]And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
\[24]And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[25]Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
\[26]And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unexpectedly to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
\[27]Wherefore did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with delight, and with songs, with timbrel, and with harp?
\[28]And have not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing.
\[29]It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke unto me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
\[30]And now, though you would essentially be gone, because you sore longed after your father's house, yet wherefore have you stolen my gods?
\[31]And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Possibly you would take by force your daughters from me.
\[32]With whomsoever you find your gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern you what is yours with me, and take it to you. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
\[33]And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
\[34]Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
\[35]And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.
\[36]And Jacob was angry, and find fault with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?
\[37]Whereas you have searched all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both.
\[38]This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock have I not eaten.
\[39]That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto you; I bare the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
\[40]Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
\[41]Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.
\[42]Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you had sent me away now empty. God has seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked you last night.
\[43]And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
\[44]Now therefore come you, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you.
\[45]And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
\[46]And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
\[47]And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
\[48]And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
\[49]And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.
\[50]If you shall afflict my daughters, or if you shall take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you.
\[51]And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:
\[52]This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
\[53]The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
\[54]Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
\[55]And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

\[2]And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\[3]And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall all of you speak unto my lord Esau; Your servant Jacob says thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
\[5]And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and male servants, and female servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight.
\[6]And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.
\[7]Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
\[8]And said, If Esau come to the one company, and strike it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
\[9]And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which said unto me, Return unto your country, and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:
\[10]I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed unto your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
\[11]Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and strike me, and the mother with the children.
\[12]And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
\[13]And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
\[14]Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
\[15]Thirty milk giving camels with their colts, forty cattle, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
\[16]And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.
\[17]And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meet you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? and where go you? and whose are these before you?
\[18]Then you shall say, They be your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.
\[19]And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall all of you speak unto Esau, when all of you find him.
\[20]And say all of you moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; possibly he will accept of me.
\[21]So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
\[22]And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
\[23]And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
\[24]And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
\[25]And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
\[26]And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.
\[27]And he said unto him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.
\[28]And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.
\[29]And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Wherefore is it that you do ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
\[30]And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
\[31]And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
\[32]Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

\[2]And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
\[3]And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
\[4]And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
\[5]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with you? And he said, The children which God has graciously given your servant.
\[6]Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
\[7]And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\[8]And he said, What mean you by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
\[9]And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that you have unto yourself.
\[10]And Jacob said, Nay, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.
\[11]Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
\[12]And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.
\[13]And he said unto him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should beat them one day, all the flock will die.
\[14]Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goes before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
\[15]And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needs it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
\[16]So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
\[17]And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

\[3]And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly unto the damsel.
\[4]And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
\[5]And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
\[6]And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
\[7]And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.
\[8]And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
\[9]And make all of you marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
\[10]And all of you shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade all of you therein, and get you possessions therein.
\[11]And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what all of you shall say unto me I will give.
\[12]Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as all of you shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
\[13]And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
\[14]And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
\[15]But in this will we consent unto you: If all of you will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
\[16]Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
\[17]But if all of you will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
\[18]And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
\[19]And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.
\[20]And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
\[21]These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
\[22]Only herein will the men consent unto us in order to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
\[23]Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
\[24]And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
\[25]And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
\[26]And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

\[28]They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
\[29]And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.
\[30]And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, All of you have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

\[3]And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

\[3]Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
\[4]And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
\[5]And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
\[6]And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
\[7]For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made reverence to my sheaf.
\[8]And his brethren said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us? or shall you indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
\[9]And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made reverence to me.
\[10]And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth?
\[11]And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
\[12]And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
\[13]And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not your brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send you unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
\[14]And he said to him, Go, I pray you, see whether it be well with your brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
\[15]And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seek you?
\[16]And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray you, where they feed their flocks.
\[17]And the man said, They are departed behind; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
\[18]And when they saw him far off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
\[19]And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes.
\[20]Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
\[21]And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
\[22]And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
\[23]And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
\[24]And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
\[25]And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
\[26]And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
\[27]Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
\[28]Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
\[29]And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
\[30]And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?
\[31]And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
\[32]And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be your son's coat or no.
\[33]And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
\[34]And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
\[35]And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
\[36]And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

nd it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
\[2]And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
\[3]And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
\[4]And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
\[5]And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
\[6]And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
\[7]And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
\[8]And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto your brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.
\[9]And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
\[10]And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
\[11]Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at your father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest possibly he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
\[12]And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
\[13]And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
\[14]And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
\[15]When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
\[16]And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray you, let me come in unto you; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in unto me?
\[17]And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?
\[18]And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in yours hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
\[19]And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
\[20]And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
\[21]Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
\[22]And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
\[23]And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her.
\[24]And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter in law has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
\[25]When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
\[26]And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She has been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he had sexual contact with her again no more.
\[27]And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
\[28]And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
\[29]And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How have you broken forth? this breach be upon you: therefore his name was called Pharez.
\[30]And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

nd Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
\[2]And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
\[3]And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
\[4]And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
\[5]And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.
\[6]And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.
\[7]And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
\[8]But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knows not what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand;
\[9]There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back any thing from me but you, because you are his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
\[10]And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
\[11]And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
\[12]And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
\[13]And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
\[14]That she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he has brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
\[15]And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
\[16]And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
\[17]And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which you have brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
\[18]And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
\[19]And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner did your servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
\[20]And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
\[21]But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
\[22]And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
\[23]The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

nd it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
\[2]And Pharaoh was angry against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
\[3]And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
\[4]And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
\[5]And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
\[6]And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
\[7]And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look all of you so sadly to day?
\[8]And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
\[9]And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
\[10]And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
\[11]And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
\[12]And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
\[13]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up yours head, and restore you unto your place: and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler.
\[14]But think on me when it shall be well with you, and show kindness, I pray you, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
\[15]For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
\[16]When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
\[17]And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
\[18]And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
\[19]Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.
\[20]And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
\[21]And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
\[22]But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

nd it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
\[2]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured cattle and well fed; and they fed in a meadow.
\[3]And, behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and thin; and stood by the other cattle upon the brink of the river.
\[4]And the ill favoured and thin cattle did eat up the seven well favoured and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.
\[5]And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
\[6]And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
\[7]And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
\[8]And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
\[9]Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
\[10]Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
\[11]And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
\[12]And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
\[13]And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
\[14]Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
\[15]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it.
\[16]And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
\[17]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
\[18]And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, well fed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
\[19]And, behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
\[20]And the lean and the ill favoured cattle did eat up the first seven fat cattle:
\[21]And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
\[22]And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
\[23]And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
\[24]And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
\[25]And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
\[26]The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
\[27]And the seven thin and ill favoured cattle that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
\[28]This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he shows unto Pharaoh.
\[29]Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
\[30]And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
\[31]And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
\[32]And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
\[33]Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\[34]Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven abundant years.
\[35]And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
\[36]And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
\[37]And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
\[38]And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
\[39]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God has showed you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are:
\[40]You shall be over my house, and according unto your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you.
\[41]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
\[42]And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
\[43]And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
\[44]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
\[45]And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
\[46]And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[47]And in the seven abundant years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
\[48]And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
\[49]And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
\[50]And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
\[51]And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
\[52]And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
\[53]And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
\[54]And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\[55]And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he says to you, do.
\[56]And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
\[57]And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph in order to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

\[2]And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
\[3]And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
\[4]But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest possibly mischief befall him.
\[5]And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\[6]And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
\[7]And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come all of you? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
\[8]And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
\[9]And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, All of you are spies; to see the nakedness of the land all of you are come.
\[10]And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are your servants come.
\[11]We are all one man's sons; we are true men, your servants are no spies.
\[12]And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land all of you are come.
\[13]And they said, Your servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
\[14]And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spoke unto you, saying, All of you are spies:
\[15]Hereby all of you shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh all of you shall not go forth behind, except your youngest brother come here.
\[16]Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and all of you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely all of you are spies.
\[17]And he put them all together into ward three days.
\[18]And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
\[19]If all of you be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go all of you, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
\[20]But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and all of you shall not die. And they did so.
\[21]And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
\[22]And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and all of you would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
\[23]And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.
\[24]And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
\[25]Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
\[26]And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
\[27]And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass animal food in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
\[28]And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God has done unto us?
\[29]And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
\[30]The man, who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
\[31]And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:
\[32]We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
\[33]And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that all of you are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
\[34]And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that all of you are no spies, but that all of you are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and all of you shall trade in the land.
\[35]And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
\[36]And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have all of you bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and all of you will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
\[37]And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.
\[38]And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which all of you go, then shall all of you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

\[7]And they said, The man asked us strictly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have all of you another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
\[8]And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.
\[9]I will be guarantor for him; of my hand shall you require him: if I bring him not unto you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever:
\[10]For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
\[11]And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
\[12]And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; possibly it was an oversight:
\[13]Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
\[14]And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
\[15]And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
\[16]And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
\[17]And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
\[18]And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
\[19]And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
\[20]And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
\[21]And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
\[22]And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
\[23]And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
\[24]And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses animal food.
\[25]And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
\[26]And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
\[27]And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom all of you spoke? Is he yet alive?
\[28]And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made reverence.
\[29]And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom all of you spoke unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto you, my son.
\[30]And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
\[31]And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
\[32]And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
\[33]And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
\[34]And he took and sent portions unto them from before him: but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.

\[2]And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
\[3]As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
\[4]And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you do overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have all of you rewarded evil for good?
\[5]Is not this it in which my lord drinks, and whereby indeed he divines? all of you have done evil in so doing.
\[6]And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words.
\[7]And they said unto him, Wherefore says my lord these words? God forbid that your servants should do according to this thing:
\[8]Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?
\[9]With whomsoever of your servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
\[10]And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and all of you shall be blameless.
\[11]Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
\[12]And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
\[13]Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
\[14]And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
\[15]And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that all of you have done? know all of you not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
\[16]And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
\[17]And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
\[18]Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not yours anger burn against your servant: for you are even as Pharaoh.
\[19]My lord asked his servants, saying, Have all of you a father, or a brother?
\[20]And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.
\[21]And you said unto your servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
\[22]And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
\[23]And you said unto your servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, all of you shall see my face no more.
\[24]And it came to pass when we came up unto your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
\[25]And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
\[26]And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
\[27]And your servant my father said unto us, All of you know that my wife bare me two sons:
\[28]And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
\[29]And if all of you take this also from me, and mischief befall him, all of you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
\[30]Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
\[31]It shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
\[32]For your servant became guarantor for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto you, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
\[33]Now therefore, I pray you, let your servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
\[34]For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest possibly I see the evil that shall come on my father.

\[2]And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
\[3]And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
\[4]And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom all of you sold into Egypt.
\[5]Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that all of you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
\[6]For these two years has the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earring nor harvest.
\[7]And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
\[8]So now it was not you that sent me here, but God: and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[9]Haste all of you, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
\[10]And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near unto me, you, and your children, and your children's children, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:
\[11]And there will I nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine; lest you, and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.
\[12]And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks unto you.
\[13]And all of you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that all of you have seen; and all of you shall haste and bring down my father here.
\[14]And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
\[15]Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
\[16]And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
\[17]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto your brethren, This do all of you; load your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
\[18]And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and all of you shall eat the fat of the land.
\[19]Now you are commanded, this do all of you; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
\[20]Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt are yours.
\[21]And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
\[22]To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
\[23]And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and food for his father by the way.
\[24]So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that all of you fall not out by the way.
\[25]And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
\[26]And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
\[27]And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
\[28]And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

\[4]I will go down with you into Egypt; and I will also surely bring you up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon yours eyes.
\[5]And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
\[6]And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had got in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
\[7]His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

\[14]And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

\[2]And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
\[3]And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
\[4]They said moreover unto Pharaoh, In order to sojourn in the land are we come; for your servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
\[5]And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, Your father and your brethren are come unto you:
\[6]The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
\[7]And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
\[8]And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old are you?
\[9]And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
\[10]And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
\[11]And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\[12]And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
\[13]And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
\[14]And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
\[15]And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence? for the money fails.
\[16]And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
\[17]And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
\[18]When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
\[19]Wherefore shall we die before yours eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
\[20]And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
\[21]And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
\[22]Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
\[23]Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and all of you shall sow the land.
\[24]And it shall come to pass in the increase, that all of you shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
\[25]And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
\[26]And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.
\[27]And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
\[28]And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
\[29]And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:
\[30]But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as you have said.

\[2]And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, your son Joseph comes unto you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
\[3]And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\[4]And said unto me, Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people; and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.
\[5]And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto you in the land of Egypt before I came unto you into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
\[6]And your issue, which you brought forth after them, shall be yours, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
\[7]And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
\[8]And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
\[9]And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, unto me, and I will bless them.
\[10]Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
\[11]And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, lo, God has showed me also your seed.
\[12]And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
\[13]And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
\[14]And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wisely; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\[15]And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
\[16]The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
\[17]And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
\[18]And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put your right hand upon his head.
\[19]And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
\[20]And he blessed them that day, saying, In you shall Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\[21]And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

\[29]And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
\[30]In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
\[31]There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
\[32]The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
\[33]And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered unto his people.

nd Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
\[2]And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
\[3]And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
\[4]And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\[5]My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.
\[6]And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according as he made you swear.
\[7]And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\[8]And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
\[9]And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
\[10]And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
\[11]And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
\[12]And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
\[13]For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
\[14]And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
\[15]And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will possibly hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
\[16]And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Your father did command before he died, saying,
\[17]So shall all of you say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brethren, and their sin; for they did unto you evil: and now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him.
\[18]And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be your servants.
\[19]And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
\[20]But as for you, all of you thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
\[21]Now therefore fear all of you not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.
\[22]And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
\[23]And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
\[24]And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[25]And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and all of you shall carry up my bones from behind.
\[26]So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

ow these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
\[2]Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\[3]Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\[4]Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\[5]And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
\[6]And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
\[7]And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
\[8]Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
\[9]And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
\[10]Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falls out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
\[11]Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
\[12]But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
\[13]And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
\[14]And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.
\[15]And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
\[16]And he said, When all of you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then all of you shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
\[17]But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
\[18]And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have all of you done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
\[19]And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them.
\[20]Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
\[21]And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
\[22]And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born all of you shall cast into the river, and every daughter all of you shall keep alive.

nd there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
\[2]And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
\[3]And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with bitumen and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
\[4]And his sister stood far off, to know what would be done to him.
\[5]And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
\[6]And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
\[7]Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?
\[8]And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
\[9]And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.
\[10]And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
\[11]And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
\[12]And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
\[13]And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smite you your fellow?
\[14]And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
\[15]Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
\[16]Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
\[17]And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
\[18]And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that all of you are come so soon to day?
\[19]And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.
\[20]And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that all of you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
\[21]And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
\[22]And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
\[23]And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
\[24]And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
\[25]And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.

ow Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
\[2]And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
\[3]And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
\[4]And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
\[5]And he said, Draw not nigh here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place whereon you stand is holy ground.
\[6]Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
\[7]And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
\[8]And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
\[9]Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
\[10]Come now therefore, and I will send you unto Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\[11]And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
\[12]And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token unto you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, all of you shall serve God upon this mountain.
\[13]And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers has sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
\[14]And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, I AM has sent me unto you.
\[15]And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shall you say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
\[16]Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:
\[17]And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
\[18]And they shall hearken to your voice: and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and all of you shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has met with us: and now let us go, we plead to you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
\[19]And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
\[20]And I will stretch out my hand, and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
\[21]And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when all of you go, all of you shall not go empty.
\[22]But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and all of you shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and all of you shall spoil the Egyptians.

\[2]And the LORD said unto him, What is that in yours hand? And he said, A rod.
\[3]And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
\[4]And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth yours hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
\[5]That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared unto you.
\[6]And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now yours hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
\[7]And he said, Put yours hand into your bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe you, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
\[9]And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which you take out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
\[10]And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither in time past, nor since you have spoken unto your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
\[11]And the LORD said unto him, Who has made man's mouth? or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?
\[12]Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall say.
\[13]And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray you, by the hand of him whom you will send.
\[14]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you: and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
\[15]And you shall speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what all of you shall do.
\[16]And he shall be your spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to you instead of a mouth, and you shall be to him instead of God.
\[17]And you shall take this rod in yours hand, wherewith you shall do signs.
\[18]And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray you, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
\[19]And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought your life.
\[20]And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
\[21]And the LORD said unto Moses, When you go to return into Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in yours hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
\[22]And you shall say unto Pharaoh, Thus says the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:
\[23]And I say unto you, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, even your firstborn.
\[24]And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.
\[25]Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.
\[26]So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband you are, because of the circumcision.
\[27]And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
\[28]And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.
\[29]And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
\[30]And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

\[2]And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.
\[3]And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
\[4]And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do all of you, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
\[5]And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and all of you make them rest from their burdens.
\[6]And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
\[7]All of you shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as in time past: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\[8]And the tale of the bricks, which they did make in time past, all of you shall lay upon them; all of you shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
\[9]Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.
\[10]And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
\[11]Go all of you, get you straw where all of you can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.
\[12]So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
\[13]And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
\[14]And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have all of you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as in time past?
\[15]Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore deal you thus with your servants?
\[16]There is no straw given unto your servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in yours own people.
\[17]But he said, All of you are idle, all of you are idle: therefore all of you say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.
\[18]Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall all of you deliver the tale of bricks.
\[19]And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, All of you shall not diminish ought from your bricks of your daily task.
\[20]And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
\[21]And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because all of you have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
\[22]And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore have you so evil pleaded this people? why is it that you have sent me?
\[23]For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have you delivered your people at all.

\[4]And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

\[10]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[11]Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
\[12]And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

\[9]When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then you shall say unto Aaron, Take your rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.
\[10]And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
\[11]Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
\[12]For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
\[13]And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
\[14]And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.
\[15]Get you unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goes out unto the water; and you shall stand by the river's brink meeting him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in yours hand.
\[16]And you shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews has sent me unto you, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, until now you would not hear.
\[17]Thus says the LORD, In this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will strike with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
\[18]And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river.
\[19]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out yours hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.
\[20]And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and stroke the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
\[21]And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[22]And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.
\[23]And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.
\[24]And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
\[25]And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.

\[2]And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will strike all your borders with frogs:
\[3]And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into yours house, and into your bedchamber, and upon your bed, and into the house of your servants, and upon your people, and into yours ovens, and into your kneading troughs:
\[4]And the frogs shall come up both on you, and upon your people, and upon all your servants.
\[5]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth yours hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
\[6]And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
\[7]And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
\[8]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Implore the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.
\[9]And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I implore for you, and for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only?
\[10]And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to your word: that you may know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.
\[11]And the frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people; they shall remain in the river only.
\[12]And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.
\[13]And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
\[14]And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
\[15]But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
\[16]And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[17]And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and stroke the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[18]And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
\[19]Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
\[20]And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he comes forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus says the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[21]Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon you, and upon your servants, and upon your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
\[22]And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
\[23]And I will put a division between my people and your people: tomorrow shall this sign be.
\[24]And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.
\[25]And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go all of you, sacrifice to your God in the land.
\[26]And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
\[27]We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.
\[28]And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that all of you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only all of you shall not go very far away: implore for me.
\[29]And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you, and I will implore the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
\[30]And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and implored the LORD.
\[31]And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

\[2]For if you refuse to let them go, and will hold them still,
\[3]Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon your cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.
\[4]And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.
\[5]And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.
\[6]And the LORD did that thing on the next day, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
\[7]And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
\[8]And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
\[9]And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
\[10]And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.
\[11]And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
\[12]And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.
\[13]And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[14]For I will at this time send all my plagues upon yours heart, and upon your servants, and upon your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
\[15]For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may strike you and your people with pestilence; and you shall be cut off from the earth.
\[16]And in very deed for this cause have I raised you up, in order to show in you my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
\[17]As yet exalt you yourself against my people, that you will not let them go?
\[18]Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
\[19]Send therefore now, and gather your cattle, and all that you have in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
\[20]He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
\[21]And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.
\[22]And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth yours hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
\[23]And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
\[24]So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
\[25]And the hail stroke throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail stroke every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
\[26]Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
\[27]And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
\[28]Implore the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and all of you shall stay no longer.
\[29]And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know how that the earth is the LORD's.
\[30]But as for you and your servants, I know that all of you will not yet fear the LORD God.
\[31]And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bud.
\[32]But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
\[33]And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
\[34]And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
\[35]And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

\[2]And that you may tell in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that all of you may know how that I am the LORD.
\[3]And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
\[4]Else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow will I bring the locusts into your coast:
\[5]And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field:
\[6]And they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither your fathers, nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
\[7]And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: know you not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
\[8]And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?
\[9]And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.
\[10]And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
\[11]Not so: go now all of you that are men, and serve the LORD; for that all of you did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
\[12]And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out yours hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.
\[13]And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\[14]And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
\[15]For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\[16]Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
\[17]Now therefore forgive, I pray you, my sin only this once, and implore the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
\[18]And he went out from Pharaoh, and implored the LORD.
\[19]And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
\[20]But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
\[21]And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out yours hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
\[22]And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
\[23]They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\[24]And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go all of you, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
\[25]And Moses said, You must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.
\[26]Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.
\[27]But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
\[28]And Pharaoh said unto him, Get you from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in that day you see my face you shall die.

\[2]This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
\[3]Speak all of you unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:
\[4]And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
\[5]Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: all of you shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:
\[6]And all of you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
\[7]And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
\[8]And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
\[9]Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the inwards thereof.
\[10]And all of you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remains of it until the morning all of you shall burn with fire.
\[11]And thus shall all of you eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and all of you shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.
\[12]For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.
\[13]And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where all of you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
\[14]And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and all of you shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; all of you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
\[15]Seven days shall all of you eat unleavened bread; even the first day all of you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
\[16]And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
\[17]And all of you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this very same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall all of you observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
\[18]In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, all of you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
\[19]Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.
\[20]All of you shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall all of you eat unleavened bread.
\[21]Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
\[22]And all of you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
\[23]For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to strike you.
\[24]And all of you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons for ever.
\[25]And it shall come to pass, when all of you be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he has promised, that all of you shall keep this service.
\[26]And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean all of you by this service?
\[27]That all of you shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he stroke the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
\[28]And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\[29]And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD stroke all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
\[30]And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
\[31]And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both all of you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as all of you have said.
\[32]Also take your flocks and your herds, as all of you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
\[33]And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.
\[34]And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
\[35]And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
\[36]And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.
\[37]And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.
\[38]And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
\[39]And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
\[40]Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
\[41]And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the very same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
\[42]It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.
\[43]And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
\[44]But every man's servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
\[45]A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
\[46]In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall all of you break a bone thereof.
\[47]All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
\[48]And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
\[49]One law shall be to him that is native, and unto the stranger that sojourns among you.
\[50]Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

\[6]Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.
\[7]Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you in all your quarters.
\[8]And you shall show your son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.
\[9]And it shall be for a sign unto you upon yours hand, and for a memorial between yours eyes, that the LORD's law may be in your mouth: for with a strong hand has the LORD brought you out of Egypt.
\[10]You shall therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
\[11]And it shall be when the LORD shall bring you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore unto you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,
\[12]That you shall set apart unto the LORD all that opens the womb, and every first born that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.
\[13]And every first born of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among your children shall you redeem.
\[14]And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? that you shall say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
\[15]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
\[16]And it shall be for a token upon yours hand, and for frontlets between yours eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest possibly the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
\[18]But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.
\[19]And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and all of you shall carry up my bones away behind with you.
\[20]And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
\[21]And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:
\[22]He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

\[5]And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
\[6]And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
\[7]And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
\[8]And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.
\[9]But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.
\[10]And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.
\[11]And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore have you dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?
\[12]Is not this the word that we did tell you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
\[13]And Moses said unto the people, Fear all of you not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom all of you have seen to day, all of you shall see them again no more for ever.
\[14]The LORD shall fight for you, and all of you shall hold your peace.
\[15]And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore cry you unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:
\[16]But lift you up your rod, and stretch out yours hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
\[17]And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\[18]And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have got me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\[19]And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
\[20]And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.
\[21]And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
\[22]And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[23]And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[24]And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
\[25]And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.
\[26]And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out yours hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
\[27]And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
\[28]And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
\[29]But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
\[30]Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.
\[31]And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.

hen sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.
\[2]The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.
\[3]The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
\[4]Pharaoh's chariots and his host has he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
\[5]The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
\[6]Your right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: your right hand, O LORD, has dashed in pieces the enemy.
\[7]And in the greatness of yours excellency you have overthrown them that rose up against you: you sent forth your wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
\[8]And with the blast of your nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
\[9]The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
\[10]You did blow with your wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
\[11]Who is like unto you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
\[12]You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them.
\[13]You in your mercy have led forth the people which you have redeemed: you have guided them in your strength unto your holy habitation.
\[14]The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
\[15]Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
\[16]Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of yours arm they shall be as still as a stone; till your people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which you have purchased.
\[17]You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of yours inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which you have made for you to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands have established.
\[18]The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
\[19]For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.
\[20]And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
\[21]And Miriam answered them, Sing all of you to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.
\[22]So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
\[23]And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
\[24]And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
\[25]And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
\[26]And said, If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon you, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.
\[27]And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

nd they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
\[2]And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
\[3]And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for all of you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
\[4]Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.
\[5]And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then all of you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt:
\[7]And in the morning, then all of you shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he hears your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that all of you murmur against us?
\[8]And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD hears your murmurings which all of you murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.
\[9]And Moses spoke unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he has heard your murmurings.
\[10]And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
\[11]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[12]I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even all of you shall eat flesh, and in the morning all of you shall be filled with bread; and all of you shall know that I am the LORD your God.
\[13]And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
\[14]And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.
\[15]And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they know not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.
\[16]This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take all of you every man for them which are in his tents.
\[17]And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
\[18]And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
\[19]And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
\[20]Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was angry with them.
\[21]And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
\[22]And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
\[23]And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD has said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which all of you will bake to day, and seethe that all of you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
\[24]And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
\[25]And Moses said, Eat that to day; in order to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day all of you shall not find it in the field.
\[26]Six days all of you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
\[27]And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day in order to gather, and they found none.
\[28]And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse all of you to keep my commandments and my laws?
\[29]See, for that the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide all of you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
\[30]So the people rested on the seventh day.
\[31]And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
\[32]And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
\[33]And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
\[34]As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
\[35]And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
\[36]Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

nd all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
\[2]Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide all of you with me? wherefore do all of you tempt the LORD?
\[3]And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
\[4]And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.
\[5]And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with you of the elders of Israel; and your rod, wherewith you smote the river, take in yours hand, and go.
\[6]Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\[7]And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?
\[8]Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
\[9]And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.
\[10]So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
\[11]And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
\[12]But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
\[13]And Joshua humiliated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
\[14]And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
\[15]And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:
\[16]For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

hen Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;
\[2]Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
\[3]And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an foreigner in a strange land:
\[4]And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
\[5]And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
\[6]And he said unto Moses, I your father in law Jethro am come unto you, and your wife, and her two sons with her.
\[7]And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did reverence, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
\[8]And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
\[9]And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\[10]And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
\[11]Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
\[12]And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
\[13]And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
\[14]And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do to the people? why sit you yourself alone, and all the people stand by you from morning unto even?
\[15]And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:
\[16]When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
\[17]And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that you do is not good.
\[18]You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for this thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone.
\[19]Hearken now unto my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Be you for the people toward God, that you may bring the causes unto God:
\[20]And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
\[21]Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
\[22]And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.
\[23]If you shall do this thing, and God command you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
\[24]So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
\[25]And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\[26]And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
\[27]And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

\[2]For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.
\[3]And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
\[4]All of you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
\[5]Now therefore, if all of you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then all of you shall be an exclusive treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:
\[6]And all of you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak unto the children of Israel.
\[7]And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.
\[8]And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.
\[9]And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.
\[10]And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes,
\[11]And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
\[12]And you shall set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that all of you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:
\[13]There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.
\[14]And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
\[15]And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.
\[16]And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
\[17]And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
\[18]And mount Sinai was altogether smoking, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
\[19]And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
\[20]And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
\[21]And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
\[22]And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.
\[23]And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
\[24]And the LORD said unto him, Away, get you down, and you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.

\[4]You shall not make unto you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
\[5]You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
\[6]And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
\[7]You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.
\[8]Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
\[9]Six days shall you labour, and do all your work:
\[10]But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:
\[11]For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
\[12]Honour your father and your mother: that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God gives you.

\[14]You shall not commit adultery.
\[15]You shall not steal.
\[16]You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.
\[17]You shall not covet your neighbour's house, you shall not covet your neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbour's.
\[18]And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood far off.
\[19]And they said unto Moses, Speak you with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
\[20]And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God has come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that all of you sin not.
\[21]And the people stood far off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
\[22]And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus you shall say unto the children of Israel, All of you have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
\[23]All of you shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall all of you make unto you gods of gold.
\[24]An altar of earth you shall make unto me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and yours oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto you, and I will bless you.
\[25]And if you will make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone: for if you lift up your tool upon it, you have polluted it.

\[3]If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.
\[4]If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
\[5]And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
\[6]Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.
\[7]And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.
\[8]If she please not her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.
\[9]And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
\[10]If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
\[11]And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.
\[12]He that strikes a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.
\[13]And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.
\[14]But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; you shall take him from mine altar, that he may die.
\[15]And he that strikes his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
\[16]And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
\[17]And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
\[18]And if men strive together, and one strike another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keeps his bed:
\[19]If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that stroke him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
\[20]And if a man strike his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

\[29]I will not drive them out from before you in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against you.
\[30]By little and little I will drive them out from before you, until you be increased, and inherit the land.
\[31]And I will set your bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and you shall drive them out before you.

\[5]And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.
\[6]And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
\[7]And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.
\[8]And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.
\[9]Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:
\[10]And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.
\[11]And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.
\[12]And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.
\[13]And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
\[14]And he said unto the elders, Tarry all of you here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.
\[15]And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
\[16]And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
\[17]And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

\[26]And you shall make two rings of gold, and you shall put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the side of the ephod inward.
\[27]And two other rings of gold you shall make, and shall put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the front part thereof, opposite to the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

\[32]And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an armour of jacket, that it be not rent.
\[33]And beneath upon the hem of it you shall make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:
\[34]A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.
\[35]And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goes in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he comes out, that he die not.
\[36]And you shall make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
\[37]And you shall put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the turban; upon the forefront of the turban it shall be.
\[38]And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.
\[39]And you shall embroider the coat of fine linen, and you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the girdle of needlework.
\[40]And for Aaron's sons you shall make coats, and you shall make for them girdles, and bonnets shall you make for them, for glory and for beauty.
\[41]And you shall put them upon Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.
\[42]And you shall make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:
\[43]And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.

\[2]And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shall you make them.
\[3]And you shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.
\[4]And Aaron and his sons you shall bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.

\[11]And you shall kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[12]And you shall take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.
\[13]And you shall take all the fat that covers the inwards, and the lobe that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.
\[14]But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shall you burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.
\[15]You shall also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
\[16]And you shall slay the ram, and you shall take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.
\[17]And you shall cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.
\[18]And you shall burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\[19]And you shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
\[20]Then shall you kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
\[21]And you shall take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\[22]Also you shall take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covers the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

\[27]And you shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:
\[28]And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.
\[29]And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
\[30]And that son that is priest in his position shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.
\[31]And you shall take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.
\[32]And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[33]And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.
\[34]And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
\[35]And thus shall you do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded you: seven days shall you consecrate them.
\[36]And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.
\[37]Seven days you shall make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever touches the altar shall be holy.
\[38]Now this is that which you shall offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.
\[39]The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at even:
\[40]And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.
\[41]And the other lamb you shall offer at even, and shall do thereto according to the food offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\[42]This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto you.
\[43]And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.
\[44]And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.
\[45]And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.

\[21]So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

\[23]Take you also unto you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,
\[24]And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

\[4]To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\[5]And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
\[6]And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you;

\[14]All of you shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
\[15]Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
\[16]Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
\[17]It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

nd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\[2]And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
\[3]And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
\[4]And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\[5]And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to the LORD.
\[6]And they rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
\[7]And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
\[8]They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\[9]And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stubborn people:
\[10]Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.
\[11]And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
\[12]Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.
\[13]Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you sware by yours own self, and said unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
\[14]And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.
\[15]And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
\[16]And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
\[17]And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
\[18]And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
\[19]And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
\[20]And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
\[21]And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto you, that you have brought so great a sin upon them?
\[22]And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: you know the people, that they are set on mischief.
\[23]For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\[24]And I said unto them, Whosoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
\[25]And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
\[26]Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
\[27]And he said unto them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.
\[28]And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
\[29]For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
\[30]And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses said unto the people, All of you have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; possibly I shall make an atonement for your sin.
\[31]And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
\[32]Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.
\[33]And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
\[34]Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto you: behold, mine Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
\[35]And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

\[2]And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
\[3]Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you; for you are a stubborn people: lest I consume you in the way.
\[4]And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
\[5]For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, All of you are a stubborn people: I will come up into the midst of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do unto you.
\[6]And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
\[7]And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, far off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.
\[8]And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.
\[9]And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.
\[10]And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.
\[11]And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaks unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
\[12]And Moses said unto the LORD, See, you says unto me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in my sight.
\[13]Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found grace in your sight, show me now your way, that I may know you, that I may find grace in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.
\[14]And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.
\[15]And he said unto him, If your presence go not with me, carry us not up behind.
\[16]For wherein shall it be known here that I and your people have found grace in your sight? is it not in that you go with us? so shall we be separated, I and your people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.
\[17]And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken: for you have found grace in my sight, and I know you by name.
\[18]And he said, I plead to you, show me your glory.
\[19]And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
\[20]And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
\[21]And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand upon a rock:
\[22]And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:
\[23]And I will take away mine hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

\[3]And no man shall come up with you, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
\[4]And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

\[7]Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
\[8]And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
\[9]And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stubborn people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for yours inheritance.
\[10]And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.

\[12]Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you go, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you:
\[13]But all of you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:
\[14]For you shall worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
\[15]Lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call you, and you eat of his sacrifice;
\[16]And you take of their daughters unto your sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make your sons go a whoring after their gods.
\[17]You shall make you no molten gods.
\[18]The feast of unleavened bread shall you keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.
\[19]All that opens the womb is mine; and every first born among your cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
\[20]But the first born of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you redeem him not, then shall you break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
\[21]Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in earring time and in harvest you shall rest.
\[22]And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.
\[23]Three times in the year shall all your male children appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
\[24]For I will cast out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither shall any man desire your land, when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
\[25]You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
\[26]The first of the first-fruits of your land you shall bring unto the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
\[27]And the LORD said unto Moses, Write you these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
\[28]And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
\[29]And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses know not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.
\[30]And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
\[31]And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.
\[32]And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
\[33]And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
\[34]But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
\[35]And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

\[31]And he has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
\[32]And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\[33]And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

\[3]And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it likewise. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.
\[4]And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
\[5]And they spoke unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.
\[6]And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
\[7]For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

\[32]When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.

\[35]And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
\[36]And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
\[37]But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
\[38]For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

\[14]And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
\[15]And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
\[16]And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.
\[17]But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[18]And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
\[19]And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
\[20]And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
\[21]And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[22]And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
\[23]And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
\[24]And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
\[25]And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
\[26]And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:
\[27]And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.
\[28]And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\[29]And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[30]And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
\[31]And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
\[32]And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread shall all of you burn with fire.
\[33]And all of you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
\[34]As he has done this day, so the LORD has commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
\[35]Therefore shall all of you abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that all of you die not: for so I am commanded.
\[36]So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

nd it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
\[2]And he said unto Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
\[3]And unto the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take all of you a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
\[4]Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a food offering mingled with oil: in order to day the LORD will appear unto you.
\[5]And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
\[6]And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that all of you should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
\[7]And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make an atonement for yourself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
\[8]Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
\[9]And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
\[10]But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[11]And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
\[12]And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
\[13]And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
\[14]And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.
\[15]And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
\[16]And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.
\[17]And he brought the food offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
\[18]He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
\[19]And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covers the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver:
\[20]And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
\[21]And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
\[22]And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
\[23]And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
\[24]And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

\[2]And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
\[3]Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
\[4]And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
\[5]So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
\[6]And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest all of you die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, mourn for the burning which the LORD has kindled.
\[7]And all of you shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest all of you die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
\[8]And the LORD spoke unto Aaron, saying,
\[9]Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when all of you go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest all of you die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
\[10]And that all of you may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
\[11]And that all of you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD has spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
\[12]And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the food offering that remains of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:
\[13]And all of you shall eat it in the holy place, because it is your due, and your sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.
\[14]And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall all of you eat in a clean place; you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they be your due, and your sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
\[15]The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be yours, and your sons' with you, by a statute for ever; as the LORD has commanded.
\[16]And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,
\[17]Wherefore have all of you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
\[18]Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: all of you should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
\[19]And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
\[20]And when Moses heard that, he was content.

\[33]And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\[34]When all of you be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
\[35]And he that owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seems to me there is as it were a plague in the house:
\[36]Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
\[37]And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;
\[38]Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:
\[39]And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
\[40]Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
\[41]And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
\[42]And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall daubed the house.
\[43]And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he has taken away the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;
\[44]Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
\[45]And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
\[46]Moreover he that goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
\[47]And he that lies in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
\[48]And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague has not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
\[49]And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
\[50]And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
\[51]And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
\[52]And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
\[53]But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.
\[54]This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scab,
\[55]And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
\[56]And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:
\[57]To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.

\[2]And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron your brother, that he comes not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.
\[3]Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
\[4]He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen turban shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.
\[5]And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
\[6]And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.
\[7]And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[8]And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.
\[9]And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.
\[10]But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.
\[11]And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:
\[12]And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:
\[13]And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
\[14]And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
\[15]Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
\[16]And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
\[17]And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he comes out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
\[18]And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.

\[24]And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
\[25]And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.
\[26]And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.

\[29]And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, all of you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourns among you:
\[30]For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that all of you may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.

\[6]And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

\[11]For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.
\[12]Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourns among you eat blood.
\[13]And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunts and catches any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
\[14]For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, All of you shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eats it shall be cut off.
\[15]And every soul that eats that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

\[11]And the man that lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
\[12]And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
\[13]If a man also lie with mankind, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

\[18]And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he has discovered her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
\[19]And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, nor of your father's sister: for he uncovers his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

\[21]And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
\[22]All of you shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, where I bring you to dwell therein, spew you not out.
\[23]And all of you shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
\[24]But I have said unto you, All of you shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.
\[25]All of you shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and all of you shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creeps on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
\[26]And all of you shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that all of you should be mine.
\[27]A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

\[3]And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which has had no husband; for her may he be defiled.
\[4]But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
\[5]They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
\[6]They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
\[7]They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.
\[8]You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread of your God: he shall be holy unto you: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.
\[9]And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profanes her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
\[10]And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;
\[11]Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
\[12]Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.
\[13]And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
\[14]A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.
\[15]Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.
\[16]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[17]Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of your seed in their generations that has any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
\[18]For whatsoever man he be that has a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that has a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
\[19]Or a man that is broken footed, or broken handed,
\[20]Or crooked back, or a dwarf, or that has a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken;
\[21]No man that has a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he has a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
\[22]He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
\[23]Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he has a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

\[7]And for your cattle, and for the beast that are in your land, shall all the increase thereof be food.
\[8]And you shall number seven sabbaths of years unto you, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto you forty and nine years.
\[9]Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall all of you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
\[10]And all of you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and all of you shall return every man unto his possession, and all of you shall return every man unto his family.

\[13]In the year of this jubile all of you shall return every man unto his possession.

\[21]Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
\[22]And all of you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in all of you shall eat of the old store.

\[27]Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the surplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
\[28]But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
\[29]And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
\[30]And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.

\[48]After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
\[49]Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
\[50]And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
\[51]If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

\[53]And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in your sight.

\[10]And all of you shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
\[11]And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not detest you.
\[12]And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and all of you shall be my people.
\[13]I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that all of you should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
\[14]But if all of you will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
\[15]And if all of you shall despise my statutes, or if your soul detest my judgments, so that all of you will not do all my commandments, but that all of you break my covenant:
\[16]I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and all of you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
\[17]And I will set my face against you, and all of you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and all of you shall flee when none pursues you.
\[18]And if all of you will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
\[19]And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
\[20]And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
\[21]And if all of you walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
\[22]I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.
\[23]And if all of you will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
\[24]Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
\[25]And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when all of you are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and all of you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
\[26]And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and all of you shall eat, and not be satisfied.
\[27]And if all of you will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
\[28]Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
\[29]And all of you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall all of you eat.
\[30]And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall detest you.
\[31]And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
\[32]And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
\[33]And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
\[34]Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and all of you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
\[35]As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when all of you dwelt upon it.
\[36]And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.
\[37]And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursues: and all of you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
\[38]And all of you shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
\[39]And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
\[40]If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
\[41]And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
\[42]Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
\[43]The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
\[44]And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I detest them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.
\[45]But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
\[46]These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

nd the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[2]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.
\[3]And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
\[4]And if it be a female, then your estimation shall be thirty shekels.
\[5]And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then your estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[6]And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then your estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
\[7]And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\[8]But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
\[9]And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man gives of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
\[10]He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
\[11]And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
\[12]And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.
\[13]But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto your estimation.
\[14]And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\[15]And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
\[16]And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
\[17]If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to your estimation it shall stand.
\[18]But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be decreased from your estimation.
\[19]And if he that sanctified the field will in any way redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
\[20]And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
\[21]But the field, when it goes out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.
\[22]And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;
\[23]Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of your estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give yours estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.
\[24]In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.
\[25]And all your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
\[26]Only the first born of the beasts, which should be the LORD's first born, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.
\[27]And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to yours estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.
\[28]Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.
\[29]None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.
\[30]And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.
\[31]And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
\[32]And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
\[33]He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\[34]These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

\[15]And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.

\[18]Cut all of you not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:
\[19]But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:
\[20]But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.

\[22]Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families;
\[23]From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall you number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

\[2]Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:
\[3]Both male and female shall all of you put out, without the camp shall all of you put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.
\[4]And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spoke unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\[5]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[6]Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;
\[7]Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he has trespassed.
\[8]But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
\[9]And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.
\[10]And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.
\[11]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[12]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
\[13]And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;
\[14]And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
\[15]Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
\[16]And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:
\[17]And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:
\[18]And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse:
\[19]And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of your husband, be you free from this bitter water that causes the curse:
\[20]But if you have gone aside to another instead of your husband, and if you be defiled, and some man have lain with you beside yours husband:
\[21]Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD does make your thigh to rot, and your belly to swell;
\[22]And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, to make your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
\[23]And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:
\[24]And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causes the curse: and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.
\[25]Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:
\[26]And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
\[27]And when he has made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
\[28]And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
\[29]This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goes aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;
\[30]Or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

\[3]He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
\[4]All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
\[5]All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separates himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
\[6]All the days that he separates himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body.
\[7]He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head.
\[8]All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.
\[9]And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he has defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
\[10]And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

\[13]And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
\[14]And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
\[15]And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their food offering, and their drink offerings.
\[16]And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:
\[17]And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his food offering, and his drink offering.
\[18]And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
\[19]And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:
\[20]And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.
\[21]This is the law of the Nazarite who has vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.
\[22]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[23]Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, Likewise all of you shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,
\[24]The LORD bless you, and keep you:

\[8]Then let them take a young bullock with his food offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shall you take for a sin offering.

\[15]And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.
\[16]For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
\[17]For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I stroke every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
\[18]And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.
\[19]And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

\[21]And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.
\[22]And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.

\[24]This is it that belongs unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
\[25]And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:
\[26]But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shall you do unto the Levites concerning their charge.

nd the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
\[2]Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.
\[3]In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, all of you shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall all of you keep it.
\[4]And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
\[5]And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\[6]And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
\[7]And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?
\[8]And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
\[9]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey far off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.
\[11]The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
\[12]They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
\[13]But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbears to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
\[14]And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: all of you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
\[15]And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.
\[16]So it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
\[17]And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
\[18]At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.
\[19]And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
\[20]And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
\[21]And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
\[22]Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
\[23]At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

\[2]Make you two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shall you make them: that you may use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
\[3]And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to you at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[4]And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto you.
\[5]When all of you blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
\[6]When all of you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
\[7]But when the congregation is to be gathered together, all of you shall blow, but all of you shall not sound an alarm.
\[8]And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
\[9]And if all of you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then all of you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and all of you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and all of you shall be saved from your enemies.
\[10]Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, all of you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.
\[11]And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
\[12]And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
\[13]And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[14]In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
\[15]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
\[16]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
\[17]And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.
\[18]And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
\[19]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
\[20]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
\[21]And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.
\[22]And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
\[23]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
\[24]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
\[25]And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rear guard of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
\[26]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
\[27]And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
\[28]Thus were the journeys of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.
\[29]And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.
\[30]And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
\[31]And he said, Leave us not, I pray you; forasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you may be to us instead of eyes.
\[32]And it shall be, if you go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto you.
\[33]And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.
\[34]And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.
\[35]And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let yours enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.
\[36]And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.

nd when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.
\[2]And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.
\[3]And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
\[4]And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
\[5]We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:
\[6]But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.
\[7]And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.
\[8]And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
\[9]And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
\[10]Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
\[11]And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore have you afflicted your servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people upon me?
\[12]Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say unto me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the nursing infant, unto the land which you sware unto their fathers?
\[13]Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
\[14]I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
\[15]And if you deal thus with me, kill me, I pray you, instantly, if I have found favour in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
\[16]And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.
\[17]And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon you, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.
\[18]And say you unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and all of you shall eat flesh: for all of you have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and all of you shall eat.
\[19]All of you shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
\[20]But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that all of you have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
\[21]And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
\[22]Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
\[23]And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? you shall see now whether my word shall come to pass unto you or not.
\[24]And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.
\[25]And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
\[26]But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
\[27]And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
\[28]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
\[29]And Moses said unto him, Envy you for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!
\[30]And Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\[31]And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.
\[32]And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
\[33]And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD stroke the people with a very great plague.
\[34]And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
\[35]And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.

\[2]And they said, Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? has he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.
\[3](Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)
\[4]And the LORD spoke suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out all of you three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
\[5]And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.
\[6]And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.
\[7]My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.
\[8]With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the embodiment of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were all of you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
\[9]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
\[10]And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
\[11]And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I plead to you, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.
\[12]Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
\[13]And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I plead to you.
\[14]And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.
\[15]And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

\[2]Send you men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall all of you send a man, every one a ruler among them.
\[3]And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.
\[4]And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
\[5]Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
\[6]Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
\[7]Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
\[8]Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
\[9]Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
\[10]Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
\[11]Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
\[12]Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
\[13]Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
\[14]Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
\[15]Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
\[16]These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
\[17]And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:
\[18]And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwells therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;
\[19]And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
\[20]And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be all of you of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-fruits grapes.
\[21]So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
\[22]And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
\[23]And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
\[24]The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
\[25]And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
\[26]And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
\[27]And they told him, and said, We came unto the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
\[28]Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
\[29]The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
\[30]And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
\[31]But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
\[32]And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
\[33]And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

\[2]And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!
\[3]And wherefore has the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
\[4]And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
\[5]Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
\[6]And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
\[7]And they spoke unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
\[8]If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey.
\[9]Only rebel not all of you against the LORD, neither fear all of you the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.
\[10]But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
\[11]And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be before they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?
\[12]I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a greater nation and mightier than they.
\[13]And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for you brought up this people in your might from among them;)
\[14]And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that you LORD are among this people, that you LORD are seen face to face, and that your cloud stands over them, and that you go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\[15]Now if you shall kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,
\[16]Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.
\[17]And now, I plead to you, let the power of my LORD be great, according as you have spoken, saying,
\[18]The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.
\[19]Pardon, I plead to you, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of your mercy, and as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
\[20]And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to your word:
\[21]But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
\[22]Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
\[23]Surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
\[24]But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into where he went; and his seed shall possess it.
\[25](Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\[26]And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\[27]How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
\[28]Say unto them, As truly as I live, says the LORD, as all of you have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
\[29]Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.
\[30]Doubtless all of you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\[31]But your little ones, which all of you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which all of you have despised.
\[32]But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
\[33]And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.
\[34]After the number of the days in which all of you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall all of you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and all of you shall know my breach of promise.
\[35]I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
\[36]And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,
\[37]Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
\[38]But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.
\[39]And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
\[40]And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD has promised: for we have sinned.
\[41]And Moses said, Wherefore now do all of you transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
\[42]Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that all of you be not smitten before your enemies.
\[43]For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and all of you shall fall by the sword: because all of you are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
\[44]But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
\[45]Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and stroke them, and humiliated them, even unto Hormah.

\[25]And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:
\[26]And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourns among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.
\[27]And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.
\[28]And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sins ignorantly, when he sins by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
\[29]All of you shall have one law for him that sins through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourns among them.
\[30]But the soul that does ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
\[31]Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
\[32]And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.
\[33]And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
\[34]And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
\[35]And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
\[36]And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[37]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[38]Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a thread of blue:
\[39]And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that all of you may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that all of you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which all of you use to go a whoring:
\[40]That all of you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
\[41]I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

ow Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:
\[2]And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
\[3]And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, All of you take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift all of you up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
\[4]And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
\[5]And he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near unto him.
\[6]This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
\[7]And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD does choose, he shall be holy: all of you take too much upon you, all of you sons of Levi.
\[8]And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, all of you sons of Levi:
\[9]Seems it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?
\[10]And he has brought you near to him, and all your brethren the sons of Levi with you: and seek all of you the priesthood also?
\[11]For which cause both you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that all of you murmur against him?
\[12]And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
\[13]Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except you make yourself altogether a prince over us?
\[14]Moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
\[15]And Moses was very angry, and said unto the LORD, Respect not you their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
\[16]And Moses said unto Korah, Be you and all your company before the LORD, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:
\[17]And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring all of you before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.
\[18]And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
\[19]And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.
\[20]And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
\[21]Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
\[22]And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?
\[23]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[24]Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\[25]And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
\[26]And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest all of you be consumed in all their sins.
\[27]So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
\[28]And Moses said, Hereby all of you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.
\[29]If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD has not sent me.
\[30]But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then all of you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
\[31]And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:
\[32]And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.
\[33]They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
\[34]And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
\[35]And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
\[36]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[37]Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
\[38]The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
\[39]And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
\[40]To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
\[41]But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, All of you have killed the people of the LORD.
\[42]And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
\[43]And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[44]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[45]Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
\[46]And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
\[47]And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
\[48]And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
\[49]Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
\[50]And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

\[3]And you shall write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

\[7]And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
\[8]And it came to pass, that on the next day Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
\[9]And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
\[10]And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
\[11]And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
\[12]And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.

\[2]And your brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you with you, that they may be joined unto you, and minister unto you: but you and your sons with you shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
\[3]And they shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor all of you also, die.
\[4]And they shall be joined unto you, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
\[5]And all of you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
\[6]And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[7]Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and all of you shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes nigh shall be put to death.
\[8]And the LORD spoke unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever.
\[9]This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every food offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
\[10]In the most holy place shall you eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto you.
\[11]And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.
\[12]All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given you.
\[13]And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in yours house shall eat of it.
\[14]Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours.
\[15]Every thing that opens the womb in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the first born of unclean beasts shall you redeem.
\[16]And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to yours estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
\[17]But the first born of a cow, or the first born of a sheep, or the first born of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\[18]And the flesh of them shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.
\[19]All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto you and to your seed with you.
\[20]And the LORD spoke unto Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and yours inheritance among the children of Israel.
\[21]And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[22]Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
\[23]But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
\[24]But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
\[25]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[26]Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When all of you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then all of you shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.
\[27]And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the winepress.
\[28]Thus all of you also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which all of you receive of the children of Israel; and all of you shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.
\[29]Out of all your gifts all of you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
\[30]Therefore you shall say unto them, When all of you have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress.
\[31]And all of you shall eat it in every place, all of you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[32]And all of you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when all of you have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall all of you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest all of you die.

\[3]And the people find fault with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
\[4]And why have all of you brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
\[5]And wherefore have all of you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
\[6]And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.

\[9]And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
\[10]And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, all of you rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
\[11]And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he stroke the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.

\[13]This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
\[14]And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus says your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has befallen us:
\[15]How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
\[16]And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and has brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border:
\[17]Let us pass, I pray you, through your country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your borders.
\[18]And Edom said unto him, You shall not pass by me, lest I come out against you with the sword.
\[19]And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of your water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.
\[20]And he said, You shall not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
\[21]Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.

\[26]And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.

\[2]And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
\[3]And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
\[4]And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
\[5]And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have all of you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread.
\[6]And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
\[7]Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against you; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
\[8]And the LORD said unto Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks upon it, shall live.
\[9]And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
\[10]And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
\[11]And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
\[12]From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
\[13]From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
\[14]Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
\[15]And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies upon the border of Moab.
\[16]And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spoke unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
\[17]Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing all of you unto it:
\[18]The princes dug the well, the nobles of the people dug it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
\[19]And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
\[20]And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.
\[21]And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\[22]Let me pass through your land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past your borders.
\[23]And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\[24]And Israel stroke him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
\[25]And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
\[26]For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
\[27]Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
\[28]For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
\[29]Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
\[30]We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reachs unto Medeba.
\[31]Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

\[2]And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
\[3]And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
\[4]And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
\[5]He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide opposite to me:
\[6]Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: possibly I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.
\[7]And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak.
\[8]And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
\[9]And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?
\[10]And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent unto me, saying,
\[11]Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covers the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; possibly I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
\[12]And God said unto Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people: for they are blessed.
\[13]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuses to give me leave to go with you.
\[14]And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.
\[15]And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
\[16]And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, hinder you from coming unto me:
\[17]For I will promote you unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever you says unto me: come therefore, I pray you, curse me this people.
\[18]And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
\[19]Now therefore, I pray you, tarry all of you also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.
\[20]And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto you, that shall you do.
\[21]And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
\[22]And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
\[23]And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam stroke the ass, to turn her into the way.
\[24]But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
\[25]And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he stroke her again.
\[26]And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
\[27]And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he stroke the ass with a staff.
\[28]And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto you, that you have smitten me these three times?
\[29]And Balaam said unto the ass, Because you have mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill you.
\[30]And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I yours ass, upon which you have ridden ever since I was yours unto this day? was I ever known to do so unto you? And he said, Nay.
\[31]Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
\[32]And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore have you smitten yours ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:
\[33]And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain you, and saved her alive.
\[34]And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.
\[35]And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\[36]And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.
\[37]And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto you to call you? wherefore came you not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote you to honour?
\[38]And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto you: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
\[39]And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
\[40]And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
\[41]And it came to pass on the next day, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.

\[4]And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.
\[5]And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus you shall speak.
\[6]And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
\[7]And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
\[8]How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD has not defied?
\[9]For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
\[10]Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
\[11]And Balak said unto Balaam, What have you done unto me? I took you to curse mine enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether.
\[12]And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD has put in my mouth?
\[13]And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray you, with me unto another place, from whence you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
\[14]And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
\[15]And he said unto Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.
\[16]And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.
\[17]And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What has the LORD spoken?
\[18]And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, you son of Zippor:
\[19]God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
\[20]Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he has blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
\[21]He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.
\[22]God brought them out of Egypt; he has as it were the strength of an unicorn .
\[23]Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God wrought!
\[24]Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
\[25]And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
\[26]But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I you, saying, All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?
\[27]And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray you, I will bring you unto another place; possibly it will please God that you may curse me them from thence.
\[28]And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.
\[29]And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

\[2]And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.
\[3]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:
\[4]He has said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
\[5]How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, and your tabernacles, O Israel!
\[6]As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD has planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.

\[9]He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesses you, and cursed is he that curses you.
\[10]And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he stroke his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called you to curse mine enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.
\[11]Therefore now flee you to your place: I thought to promote you unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD has kept you back from honour.
\[12]And Balaam said unto Balak, Spoke I not also to your messengers which you sent unto me, saying,
\[13]If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD says, that will I speak?
\[14]And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.
\[15]And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:
\[16]He has said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
\[17]I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall strike the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
\[18]And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
\[19]Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remains of the city.
\[20]And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
\[21]And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is your dwelling place, and you put your nest in a rock.
\[22]Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry you away captive.

\[2]If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
\[3]If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
\[4]And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she has bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she has bound her soul shall stand.
\[5]But if her father prohibit her in the day that he hears; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she has bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
\[6]And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
\[7]And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
\[8]But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of no effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
\[9]But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
\[10]And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
\[11]And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
\[12]But if her husband has utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
\[13]Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
\[14]But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirms them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
\[15]But if he shall any ways make them void after that he has heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

nd the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[2]Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shall you be gathered unto your people.
\[3]And Moses spoke unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.
\[4]Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall all of you send to the war.
\[5]So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
\[6]And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
\[7]And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
\[8]And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
\[9]And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
\[10]And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
\[11]And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
\[12]And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
\[13]And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
\[14]And Moses was angry with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
\[15]And Moses said unto them, Have all of you saved all the women alive?
\[16]Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
\[17]Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.
\[18]But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
\[19]And do all of you abide without the camp seven days: whosoever has killed any person, and whosoever has touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
\[20]And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
\[21]And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
\[22]Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\[23]Every thing that may abide the fire, all of you shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abides not the fire all of you shall make go through the water.
\[24]And all of you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and all of you shall be clean, and afterward all of you shall come into the camp.
\[25]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[26]Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
\[27]And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
\[28]And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
\[29]Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.
\[30]And of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
\[31]And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[32]And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
\[33]And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
\[34]And threescore and one thousand asses,
\[35]And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
\[36]And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
\[37]And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
\[38]And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.
\[39]And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.
\[40]And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons.
\[41]And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[42]And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
\[43](Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
\[44]And thirty and six thousand beeves,
\[45]And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
\[46]And sixteen thousand persons;)
\[47]Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[48]And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
\[49]And they said unto Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.
\[50]We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man has got, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
\[51]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
\[52]And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
\[53](For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
\[54]And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

ow the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
\[2]The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
\[3]Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
\[4]Even the country which the LORD stroke before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and your servants have cattle:
\[5]Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in your sight, let this land be given unto your servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.
\[6]And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall all of you sit here?
\[7]And wherefore discourage all of you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD has given them?
\[8]Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
\[9]For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
\[10]And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
\[11]Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
\[12]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.
\[13]And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.
\[14]And, behold, all of you are risen up in your fathers' position, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.
\[15]For if all of you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and all of you shall destroy all this people.
\[16]And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
\[17]But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
\[18]We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
\[19]For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
\[20]And Moses said unto them, If all of you will do this thing, if all of you will go armed before the LORD to war,
\[21]And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,
\[22]And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward all of you shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
\[23]But if all of you will not do so, behold, all of you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.
\[24]Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.
\[25]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke unto Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.
\[26]Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
\[27]But your servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord says.
\[28]So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
\[29]And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then all of you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
\[30]But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
\[31]And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD has said unto your servants, so will we do.
\[32]We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.
\[33]And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.
\[34]And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\[35]And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
\[36]And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.
\[37]And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
\[38]And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they built.
\[39]And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.
\[40]And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
\[41]And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.
\[42]And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

\[48]And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
\[49]And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.
\[50]And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
\[51]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When all of you are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
\[52]Then all of you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:
\[53]And all of you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.
\[54]And all of you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more all of you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer all of you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers all of you shall inherit.
\[55]But if all of you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which all of you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein all of you dwell.
\[56]Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.

nd the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[2]Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When all of you come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)
\[3]Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the utmost coast of the salt sea eastward:
\[4]And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:
\[5]And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the activities out of it shall be at the sea.
\[6]And as for the western border, all of you shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.
\[7]And this shall be your north border: from the great sea all of you shall point out for you mount Hor:
\[8]From mount Hor all of you shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the activities out of the border shall be to Zedad:
\[9]And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the activities out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.
\[10]And all of you shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:
\[11]And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:
\[12]And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the activities out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.
\[13]And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which all of you shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:
\[14]For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:
\[15]The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
\[16]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[17]These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
\[18]And all of you shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.
\[19]And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
\[20]And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
\[21]Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
\[22]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
\[23]The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
\[24]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
\[25]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
\[26]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
\[27]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
\[28]And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
\[29]These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

nd the LORD spoke unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
\[2]Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and all of you shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.
\[3]And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
\[4]And the suburbs of the cities, which all of you shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
\[5]And all of you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
\[6]And among the cities which all of you shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which all of you shall appoint for the murderer, that he may flee thither: and to them all of you shall add forty and two cities.
\[7]So all the cities which all of you shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall all of you give with their suburbs.
\[8]And the cities which all of you shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many all of you shall give many; but from them that have few all of you shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inherits.
\[9]And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying,
\[10]Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When all of you be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
\[11]Then all of you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which kills any person at unexpectedly.
\[12]And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the murderer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.
\[13]And of these cities which all of you shall give six cities shall all of you have for refuge.
\[14]All of you shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall all of you give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
\[15]These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that kills any person unexpectedly may flee thither.
\[16]And if he strike him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[17]And if he strike him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[18]Or if he strike him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\[19]The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meet him, he shall slay him.
\[20]But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;
\[21]Or in enmity strike him with his hand, that he die: he that stroke him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meet him.
\[22]But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,
\[23]Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
\[24]Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
\[25]And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, where he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
\[26]But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, where he was fled;
\[27]And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
\[28]Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
\[29]So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\[30]Whoso kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
\[31]Moreover all of you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
\[32]And all of you shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
\[33]So all of you shall not pollute the land wherein all of you are: for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
\[34]Defile not therefore the land which all of you shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

nd the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
\[2]And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
\[3]And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe unto which they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
\[4]And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe unto which they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
\[5]And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has said well.
\[6]This is the thing which the LORD does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
\[7]So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\[8]And every daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
\[9]Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
\[10]Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
\[11]For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:
\[12]And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\[13]These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

hese be the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite to the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\[2](There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)
\[3]And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;
\[4]After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:
\[5]On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
\[6]The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, All of you have dwelt long enough in this mount:
\[7]Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
\[8]Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
\[9]And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
\[10]The LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, all of you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
\[11](The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as all of you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!)
\[12]How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\[13]Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
\[14]And all of you answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.
\[15]So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
\[16]And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
\[17]All of you shall not respect persons in judgment; but all of you shall hear the small as well as the great; all of you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time all the things which all of you should do.
\[19]And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which all of you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.
\[20]And I said unto you, All of you are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God does give unto us.
\[21]Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of your fathers has said unto you; fear not, neither be discouraged.
\[22]And all of you came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
\[23]And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
\[24]And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
\[25]And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God does give us.
\[26]Notwithstanding all of you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
\[27]And all of you murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\[28]Where shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
\[29]Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
\[30]The LORD your God which goes before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
\[31]And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bare you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that all of you went, until all of you came into this place.
\[32]Yet in this thing all of you did not believe the LORD your God,
\[33]Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way all of you should go, and in a cloud by day.
\[34]And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
\[35]Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers.
\[36]Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his children, because he has wholly followed the LORD.
\[37]Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in thither.
\[38]But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\[39]Moreover your little ones, which all of you said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
\[40]But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\[41]Then all of you answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when all of you had girded on every man his weapons of war, all of you were ready to go up into the hill.
\[42]And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest all of you be smitten before your enemies.
\[43]So I spoke unto you; and all of you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.
\[44]And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.
\[45]And all of you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
\[46]So all of you abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that all of you abode there.

hen we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
\[2]And the LORD spoke unto me, saying,
\[3]All of you have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
\[4]And command you the people, saying, All of you are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take all of you good heed unto yourselves therefore:
\[5]Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.
\[6]All of you shall buy food of them for money, that all of you may eat; and all of you shall also buy water of them for money, that all of you may drink.
\[7]For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the works of your hand: he knows your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
\[8]And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\[9]And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
\[10]The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
\[11]Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.
\[12]The Horims also dwelt in Seir in time past; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their position; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.
\[13]Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
\[14]And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD swore unto them.
\[15]For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
\[16]So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
\[17]That the LORD spoke unto me, saying,
\[18]You are to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
\[19]And when you come nigh opposite to the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
\[20](That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
\[21]A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their position:
\[22]As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their position even unto this day:
\[23]And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their position.)
\[24]Rise all of you up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into yours hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
\[25]This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.
\[26]And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
\[27]Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
\[28]You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
\[29](As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives us.
\[30]But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as appears this day.
\[31]And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.
\[32]Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
\[33]And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we stroke him, and his sons, and all his people.
\[34]And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
\[35]Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
\[36]From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:
\[37]Only unto the land of the children of Ammon you came not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

hen we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
\[2]And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do unto him as you did unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
\[3]So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we stroke him until none was left to him remaining.
\[4]And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[5]All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside towns without protective walls a great many.
\[6]And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.
\[7]But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
\[8]And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
\[9](Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
\[10]All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\[11]For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
\[12]And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
\[13]And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
\[14]Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.
\[15]And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
\[16]And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
\[17]The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
\[18]And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: all of you shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.
\[19]But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that all of you have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
\[20]Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond Jordan: and then shall all of you return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
\[21]And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Yours eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms where you pass.
\[22]All of you shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
\[23]And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
\[24]O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your might?
\[25]I pray you, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
\[26]But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice you; speak no more unto me of this matter.
\[27]Get you up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up yours eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with yours eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.
\[28]But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.
\[29]So we abode in the valley opposite to Bethpeor.

\[9]Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which yours eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life: but teach them your sons, and your sons' sons;
\[10]Specially the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.

\[12]And the LORD spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire: all of you heard the voice of the words, but saw no embodiment; only all of you heard a voice.
\[13]And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
\[14]And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that all of you might do them in the land where all of you go over to possess it.
\[15]Take all of you therefore good heed unto yourselves; for all of you saw no manner of embodiment on the day that the LORD spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
\[16]Lest all of you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the embodiment of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
\[17]The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,
\[18]The likeness of any thing that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:
\[19]And lest you lift up yours eyes unto heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
\[20]But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as all of you are this day.
\[21]Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance:
\[22]But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but all of you shall go over, and possess that good land.
\[23]Take heed unto yourselves, lest all of you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD your God has forbidden you.
\[24]For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.
\[25]When you shall brought forth children, and children's children, and all of you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:
\[26]I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that all of you shall soon utterly perish from off the land unto which all of you go over Jordan to possess it; all of you shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
\[27]And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and all of you shall be left few in number among the heathen, where the LORD shall lead you.
\[28]And there all of you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\[29]But if from thence you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\[30]When you are in tribulation, and all these things are come upon you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the LORD your God, and shall be obedient unto his voice;
\[31](For the LORD your God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore unto them.
\[32]For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?
\[33]Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
\[34]Or has God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\[35]Unto you it was showed, that you might know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.
\[36]Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and upon earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
\[37]And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;
\[38]To drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you are, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.
\[39]Know therefore this day, and consider it in yours heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.
\[40]You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days upon the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, for ever.
\[41]Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
\[42]That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unexpectedly, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
\[43]Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
\[44]And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
\[45]These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.
\[46]On this side Jordan, in the valley opposite to Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel stroke, after they were come forth out of Egypt:
\[47]And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;
\[48]From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,
\[49]And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

nd Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that all of you may learn them, and keep, and do them.
\[2]The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
\[3]The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
\[4]The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
\[5](I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for all of you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,
\[6]I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\[7]You shall have no other gods before me.
\[8]You shall not make you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:
\[9]You shall not bow down yourself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
\[10]And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
\[11]You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.
\[12]Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
\[13]Six days you shall labour, and do all your work:
\[14]But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor yours ox, nor yours ass, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates; that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you.
\[15]And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath day.
\[16]Honour your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you; that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you, in the land which the LORD your God gives you.
\[17]You shall not kill.
\[18]Neither shall you commit adultery.
\[19]Neither shall you steal.
\[20]Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbour.
\[21]Neither shall you desire your neighbour's wife, neither shall you covet your neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is your neighbour's.
\[22]These words the LORD spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.
\[23]And it came to pass, when all of you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that all of you came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\[24]And all of you said, Behold, the LORD our God has showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives.
\[25]Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.
\[26]For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
\[27]Go you near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak you unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto you; and we will hear it, and do it.
\[28]And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when all of you spoke unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto you: they have well said all that they have spoken.
\[29]O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
\[30]Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.
\[31]But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak unto you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
\[32]All of you shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God has commanded you: all of you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[33]All of you shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, that all of you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that all of you may prolong your days in the land which all of you shall possess.

\[2]That you might fear the LORD your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.
\[3]Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that all of you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.
\[4]Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:
\[5]And you shall love the LORD your God with all yours heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.
\[6]And these words, which I command you this day, shall be in yours heart:
\[7]And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in yours house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\[8]And you shall bind them for a sign upon yours hand, and they shall be as frontlets between yours eyes.
\[9]And you shall write them upon the posts of your house, and on your gates.
\[10]And it shall be, when the LORD your God shall have brought you into the land which he swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you great and goodly cities, which you builded not,
\[11]And houses full of all good things, which you filled not, and wells dug, which you dug not, vineyards and olive trees, which you planted not; when you shall have eaten and be full;
\[12]Then beware lest you forget the LORD, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\[13]You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.
\[14]All of you shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;
\[15](For the LORD your God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and destroy you from off the face of the earth.
\[16]All of you shall not tempt the LORD your God, as all of you tempted him in Massah.
\[17]All of you shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
\[18]And you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore unto your fathers.
\[19]To cast out all yours enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.
\[20]And when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God has commanded you?
\[21]Then you shall say unto your son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:
\[22]And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:
\[23]And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers.
\[24]And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.
\[25]And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.

\[2]And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall strike them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them:
\[3]Neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give unto his son, nor his daughter shall you take unto your son.
\[4]For they will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy you suddenly.
\[5]But thus shall all of you deal with them; all of you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
\[6]For you are an holy people unto the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.
\[7]The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because all of you were more in number than any people; for all of you were the few of all people:
\[8]But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, has the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
\[9]Know therefore that the LORD your God, he is God, the faithful God, which keeps covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;
\[10]And repays them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hates him, he will repay him to his face.
\[11]You shall therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command you this day, to do them.
\[12]Wherefore it shall come to pass, if all of you hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD your God shall keep unto you the covenant and the mercy which he swore unto your fathers:
\[13]And he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you: he will also bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your land, your corn, and your wine, and yours oil, the increase of your cattle, and the flocks of your sheep, in the land which he swore unto your fathers to give you.
\[14]You shall be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
\[15]And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, upon you; but will lay them upon all them that hate you.
\[16]And you shall consume all the people which the LORD your God shall deliver you; yours eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto you.
\[17]If you shall say in yours heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
\[18]You shall not be afraid of them: but shall well remember what the LORD your God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
\[19]The great temptations which yours eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD your God brought you out: so shall the LORD your God do unto all the people of whom you are afraid.
\[20]Moreover the LORD your God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from you, be destroyed.
\[21]You shall not be affrighted at them: for the LORD your God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.
\[22]And the LORD your God will put out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon you.
\[23]But the LORD your God shall deliver them unto you, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.
\[24]And he shall deliver their kings into yours hand, and you shall destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.
\[25]The graven images of their gods shall all of you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto you, lest you be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.
\[26]Neither shall you bring an abomination into yours house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly detest it; for it is a cursed thing.

ll the commandments which I command you this day shall all of you observe to do, that all of you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers.
\[2]And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in yours heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.
\[3]And he humbled you, and suffered you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD does man live.
\[4]Your raiment waxed not old upon you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.
\[5]You shall also consider in yours heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.
\[6]Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
\[7]For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;
\[8]A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;
\[9]A land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig brass.
\[10]When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.
\[11]Beware that you forget not the LORD your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command you this day:
\[12]Lest when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
\[13]And when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
\[14]Then yours heart be lifted up, and you forget the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;
\[15]Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;
\[16]Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers knew not, that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end;
\[17]And you say in yours heart, My power and the might of mine hand has got me this wealth.
\[18]But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore unto your fathers, as it is this day.
\[19]And it shall be, if you do at all forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that all of you shall surely perish.

ear, O Israel: You are to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,
\[2]A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!
\[3]Understand therefore this day, that the LORD your God is he which goes over before you; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before your face: so shall you drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD has said unto you.
\[4]Speak not you in yours heart, after that the LORD your God has cast them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD does drive them out from before you.
\[5]Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of yours heart, do you go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\[6]Understand therefore, that the LORD your God gives you not this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stubborn people.
\[7]Remember, and forget not, how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you did depart out of the land of Egypt, until all of you came unto this place, all of you have been rebellious against the LORD.
\[8]Also in Horeb all of you provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
\[9]When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:
\[10]And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
\[11]And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
\[12]And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get you down quickly from behind; for your people which you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
\[13]Furthermore the LORD spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stubborn people:
\[14]Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.
\[15]So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
\[16]And I looked, and, behold, all of you had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: all of you had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.
\[17]And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
\[18]And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which all of you sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[19]For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was angry against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.
\[20]And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
\[21]And I took your sin, the calf which all of you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
\[22]And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, all of you provoked the LORD to wrath.
\[23]Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then all of you rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and all of you believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
\[24]All of you have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
\[25]Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
\[26]I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and yours inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
\[27]Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
\[28]Lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
\[29]Yet they are your people and yours inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your stretched out arm.

\[3]And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.
\[4]And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.
\[5]And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.
\[6]And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his position.
\[7]From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
\[8]At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

\[11]And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them.
\[12]And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
\[13]To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?
\[14]Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's your God, the earth also, with all that therein is.
\[15]Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.
\[16]Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stubborn.
\[17]For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:
\[18]He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
\[19]Love all of you therefore the stranger: for all of you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
\[20]You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you cleave, and swear by his name.

herefore you shall love the LORD your God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always.
\[2]And know all of you this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,
\[3]And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
\[4]And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them unto this day;
\[5]And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until all of you came into this place;
\[6]And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:
\[7]But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.
\[8]Therefore shall all of you keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that all of you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where all of you go to possess it;
\[9]And that all of you may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that flows with milk and honey.
\[10]For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence all of you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:
\[11]But the land, where all of you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:
\[12]A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, if all of you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
\[14]That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and yours oil.
\[15]And I will send grass in your fields for your cattle, that you may eat and be full.
\[16]Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and all of you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
\[17]And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest all of you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.
\[18]Therefore shall all of you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
\[19]And all of you shall teach them your children, speaking of them when you sit in yours house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\[20]And you shall write them upon the door posts of yours house, and upon your gates:
\[21]That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
\[22]For if all of you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;
\[23]Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and all of you shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
\[24]Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.
\[25]There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that all of you shall tread upon, as he has said unto you.
\[26]Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;
\[27]A blessing, if all of you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:
\[28]And a curse, if all of you will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which all of you have not known.
\[29]And it shall come to pass, when the LORD your God has brought you in unto the land where you go to possess it, that you shall put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
\[30]Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign opposite to Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
\[31]For all of you shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God gives you, and all of you shall possess it, and dwell therein.

\[16]According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.
\[17]And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.
\[18]I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto you, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
\[19]And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
\[20]But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.
\[21]And if you say in yours heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?
\[22]When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken, but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously: you shall not be afraid of him.

\[2]You shall separate three cities for you in the midst of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.
\[3]You shall prepare you a way, and divide the coasts of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.
\[4]And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso kills his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;
\[5]As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the wooden handle, and lights upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:
\[6]Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
\[7]Wherefore I command you, saying, You shall separate three cities for you.
\[8]And if the LORD your God enlarge your coast, as he has sworn unto your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised to give unto your fathers;
\[9]If you shall keep all these commandments to do them, which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for you, beside these three:
\[10]That innocent blood be not shed in your land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be upon you.
\[11]But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and strike him mortally that he die, and flees into one of these cities:
\[12]Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
\[13]Yours eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
\[14]You shall not remove your neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in yours inheritance, which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess it.
\[15]One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
\[16]If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;
\[17]Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;
\[18]And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;
\[19]Then shall all of you do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shall you put the evil away from among you.
\[20]And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.
\[21]And yours eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

\[3]And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, all of you approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be all of you terrified because of them;
\[4]For the LORD your God is he that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.

\[18]That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should all of you sin against the LORD your God.
\[19]When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

\[14]And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at all for money, you shall not make merchandise of her, because you have humbled her.

\[17]You have stand as a witness to the LORD this day to be your God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:

\[19]And to make you high above all nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that you may be an holy people unto the LORD your God, as he has spoken.

nd Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.
\[2]And it shall be on the day when all of you shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set you up great stones, and smear them with plaster:
\[3]And you shall write upon them all the words of this law, when you are passed over, that you may go in unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land that flows with milk and honey; as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you.
\[4]Therefore it shall be when all of you be gone over Jordan, that all of you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall smear them with plaster.
\[5]And there shall you build an altar unto the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool upon them.
\[6]You shall build the altar of the LORD your God of whole stones: and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD your God:
\[7]And you shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before the LORD your God.
\[8]And you shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
\[9]And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God.
\[10]You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you this day.
\[11]And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
\[12]These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when all of you are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
\[13]And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
\[14]And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
\[15]Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.
\[16]Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\[17]Cursed be he that removes his neighbour's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\[18]Cursed be he that makes the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\[19]Cursed be he that perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\[20]Cursed be he that lies with his father's wife; because he uncovers his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\[21]Cursed be he that lies with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\[22]Cursed be he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\[23]Cursed be he that lies with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen.

\[36]The LORD shall bring you, and your king which you shall set over you, unto a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known; and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.
\[37]And you shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations where the LORD shall lead you.

\[39]You shall plant vineyards, and dress them, but shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.
\[40]You shall have olive trees throughout all your coasts, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for yours olive shall cast his fruit.
\[41]You shall brought forth sons and daughters, but you shall not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.

\[44]He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.

\[46]And they shall be upon you for a sign and for a wonder, and upon your seed for ever.
\[47]Because you served not the LORD your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;
\[48]Therefore shall you serve yours enemies which the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in lack of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he have destroyed you.
\[49]The LORD shall bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;
\[50]A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favour to the young:
\[51]And he shall eat the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land, until you be destroyed: which also shall not leave you either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of your cattle, or flocks of your sheep, until he have destroyed you.
\[52]And he shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fenced walls come down, wherein you trusted, throughout all your land: and he shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which the LORD your God has given you.
\[53]And you shall eat the fruit of yours own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the strictness, wherewith yours enemies shall distress you:
\[54]So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:
\[55]So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he has nothing left him in the siege, and in the strictness, wherewith yours enemies shall distress you in all your gates.
\[56]The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
\[57]And toward her young one that comes out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for lack of all things secretly in the siege and strictness, wherewith yours enemy shall distress you in your gates.
\[58]If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD Your GOD;
\[59]Then the LORD will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
\[60]Moreover he will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave unto you.
\[61]Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon you, until you be destroyed.
\[62]And all of you shall be left few in number, whereas all of you were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
\[63]And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nothing; and all of you shall be plucked from off the land where you go to possess it.
\[64]And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.
\[65]And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
\[66]And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear day and night, and shall have none assurance of your life:
\[67]In the morning you shall say, Would God it were even! and at even you shall say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of yours heart wherewith you shall fear, and for the sight of yours eyes which you shall see.
\[68]And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spoke unto you, You shall see it no more again: and there all of you shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

hese are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
\[2]And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, All of you have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;
\[3]The great temptations which yours eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:
\[4]Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.
\[5]And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not becoming old upon you, and your shoe is not becoming old upon your foot.
\[6]All of you have not eaten bread, neither have all of you drunk wine or strong drink: that all of you might know that I am the LORD your God.
\[7]And when all of you came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we stroke them:
\[8]And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.
\[9]Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that all of you may prosper in all that all of you do.
\[10]All of you stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,
\[11]Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood unto the drawer of your water:
\[12]That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:
\[13]That he may establish you to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto you a God, as he has said unto you, and as he has sworn unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\[14]Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
\[15]But with him that stands here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:
\[16](For all of you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which all of you passed by;
\[17]And all of you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
\[18]Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
\[19]And it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:
\[20]The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.
\[21]And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:
\[22]So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid upon it;
\[23]And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
\[24]Even all nations shall say, Wherefore has the LORD done thus unto this land? what means the heat of this great anger?
\[25]Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:
\[26]For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:
\[27]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:
\[28]And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.
\[29]The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

\[10]If you shall hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if you turn unto the LORD your God with all yours heart, and with all your soul.

\[12]It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
\[13]Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
\[14]But the word is very nigh unto you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.
\[15]See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil;
\[16]In that I command you this day to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that you may live and multiply: and the LORD your God shall bless you in the land where you go to possess it.
\[17]But if yours heart turn away, so that you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
\[18]I denounce unto you this day, that all of you shall surely perish, and that all of you shall not prolong your days upon the land, where you pass over Jordan to go to possess it.
\[19]I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:
\[20]That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may cleave unto him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

\[2]And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD has said unto me, You shall not go over this Jordan.
\[3]The LORD your God, he will go over before you, and he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before you, as the LORD has said.
\[4]And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.
\[5]And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that all of you may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.
\[6]Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.
\[7]And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for you must go with this people unto the land which the LORD has sworn unto their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.
\[8]And the LORD, he it is that does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: fear not, neither be dismayed.
\[9]And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.
\[10]And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
\[11]When all Israel has come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
\[12]Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and your stranger that is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:
\[13]And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as all of you live in the land where all of you go over Jordan to possess it.
\[14]And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[15]And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
\[16]And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
\[17]Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?
\[18]And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
\[19]Now therefore write all of you this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
\[20]For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and becoming fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
\[21]And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
\[22]Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
\[23]And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore unto them: and I will be with you.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
\[25]That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
\[26]Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.
\[27]For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, all of you have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?
\[28]Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
\[29]For I know that after my death all of you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because all of you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

\[3]Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe all of you greatness unto our God.
\[4]He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.
\[5]They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.
\[6]Do all of you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?
\[7]Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.
\[8]When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.

\[14]Butter of cattle, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did drink the pure blood of the grape.
\[15]But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are becoming fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

\[19]And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
\[20]And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faith.
\[21]They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
\[22]For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the low hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
\[23]I will heap evil upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
\[24]They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
\[25]The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the nursing infant also with the man of gray hairs.
\[26]I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:
\[27]Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.
\[28]For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.
\[29]O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
\[30]How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?
\[31]For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
\[32]For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:
\[33]Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
\[34]Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?
\[35]To me belongs vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
\[36]For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.
\[37]And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
\[38]Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
\[39]See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
\[40]For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
\[41]If I sharpen my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
\[42]I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
\[43]Rejoice, O all of you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.
\[44]And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
\[45]And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
\[46]And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which all of you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
\[47]For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing all of you shall prolong your days in the land, where all of you go over Jordan to possess it.
\[48]And the LORD spoke unto Moses that very same day, saying,
\[49]Get you up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is opposite to Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
\[50]And die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered unto your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
\[51]Because all of you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because all of you sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
\[52]Yet you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

\[2]And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.
\[3]Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in your hand: and they sat down at your feet; every one shall receive of your words.
\[4]Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
\[5]And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
\[6]Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.
\[7]And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be you an help to him from his enemies.
\[8]And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;
\[9]Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed your word, and kept your covenant.
\[10]They shall teach Jacob your judgments, and Israel your law: they shall put incense before you, and whole burnt sacrifice upon yours altar.
\[11]Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; strike through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
\[12]And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
\[13]And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that couches beneath,
\[14]And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
\[15]And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
\[16]And for the precious things of the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
\[17]His glory is like the first born of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
\[18]And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and, Issachar, in your tents.
\[19]They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.
\[20]And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlarges Gad: he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm with the crown of the head.
\[21]And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.
\[22]And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's offspring: he shall leap from Bashan.
\[23]And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess you the west and the south.
\[24]And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
\[25]Your shoes shall be iron and brass; and as your days, so shall your strength be.
\[26]There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rides upon the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.
\[27]The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.
\[28]Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.
\[29]Happy are you, O Israel: who is like unto you, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your excellency! and yours enemies shall be found liars unto you; and you shall tread upon their high places.

\[2]And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,
\[3]And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.
\[4]And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto your seed: I have caused you to see it with yours eyes, but you shall not go over thither.
\[5]So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
\[6]And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite to Bethpeor: but no man knows of his tomb unto this day.
\[7]And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force decreased.
\[8]And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
\[9]And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[10]And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
\[11]In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
\[12]And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.

\[2]Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
\[3]Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
\[4]From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.
\[5]There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail you, nor forsake you.
\[6]Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give them.
\[7]Only be you strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper anywhere you go.
\[8]This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.
\[9]Have not I commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be you dismayed: for the LORD your God is with you anywhere you go.
\[10]Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\[11]Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days all of you shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it.
\[12]And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,
\[13]Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God has given you rest, and has given you this land.
\[14]Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but all of you shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;
\[15]Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he has given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God gives them: then all of you shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
\[16]And they answered Joshua, saying, All that you command us we will do, and anywhere you send us, we will go.
\[17]According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto you: only the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
\[18]Whosoever he be that does rebel against your commandment, and will not hearken unto your words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

\[2]And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in here to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.
\[3]And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to you, which are entered into yours house: for they be come to search out all the country.
\[4]And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I know not whence they were:
\[5]And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: where the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for all of you shall overtake them.
\[6]But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
\[7]And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
\[8]And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
\[9]And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
\[10]For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when all of you came out of Egypt; and what all of you did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom all of you utterly destroyed.
\[11]And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
\[12]Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that all of you will also show kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:
\[13]And that all of you will keep alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
\[14]And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if all of you utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.
\[15]Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
\[16]And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may all of you go your way.
\[17]And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this yours oath which you have made us swear.
\[18]Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by: and you shall bring your father, and your mother, and your brethren, and all your father's household, home unto you.
\[19]And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
\[20]And if you utter this our business, then we will be quit of yours oath which you have made us to swear.
\[21]And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\[22]And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
\[23]So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:
\[24]And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD has delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.

\[2]And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
\[3]And they commanded the people, saying, When all of you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then all of you shall remove from your place, and go after it.
\[4]Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that all of you may know the way by which all of you must go: for all of you have not passed this way in time past.
\[5]And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: in order to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
\[6]And Joshua spoke unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
\[7]And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
\[8]And you shall command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When all of you are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, all of you shall stand still in Jordan.
\[9]And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
\[10]And Joshua said, Hereby all of you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
\[11]Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passes over before you into Jordan.
\[12]Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
\[13]And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

\[4]Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

\[12]And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke unto them:
\[13]About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

\[19]And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
\[20]And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.
\[21]And he spoke unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
\[22]Then all of you shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
\[23]For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until all of you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:

\[2]At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make you sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
\[3]And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
\[4]And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
\[5]Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
\[6]For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land, which the LORD swore unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey.
\[7]And their children, whom he raised up in their position, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
\[8]And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
\[9]And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.
\[10]And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
\[11]And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the next day after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the very same day.
\[12]And the manna ceased on the next day after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
\[13]And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite to him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?
\[14]And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What says my Lord unto his servant?

\[3]And all of you shall compass the city, all you men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shall you do six days.
\[4]And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day all of you shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

\[8]And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
\[9]And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
\[10]And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, All of you shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall all of you shout.

\[12]And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
\[13]And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
\[16]And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD has given you the city.
\[17]And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
\[18]And all of you, in any way keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest all of you make yourselves accursed, when all of you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
\[19]But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
\[20]So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
\[21]And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
\[22]But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she has, as all of you swore unto her.
\[23]And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
\[24]And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
\[25]And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
\[26]And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
\[27]So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.

ut the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
\[2]And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
\[3]And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.
\[4]So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
\[5]And the men of Ai stroke of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and stroke them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
\[6]And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
\[7]And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!
\[8]O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turns their backs before their enemies!
\[9]For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall surround us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do unto your great name?
\[10]And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get you up; wherefore lie you thus upon your face?
\[11]Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.
\[12]Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except all of you destroy the accursed from among you.
\[13]Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus says the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of you, O Israel: you can not stand before yours enemies, until all of you take away the accursed thing from among you.
\[14]In the morning therefore all of you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.
\[15]And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has: because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has wrought folly in Israel.
\[16]So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
\[17]And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
\[18]And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
\[19]And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.
\[20]And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
\[21]When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
\[22]So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
\[23]And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.
\[24]And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
\[25]And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? the LORD shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
\[26]And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

nd the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
\[2]And you shall do to Ai and her king as you did unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall all of you take for a prey unto yourselves: lay you an ambush for the city behind it.
\[3]So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.
\[4]And he commanded them, saying, Behold, all of you shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be all of you all ready:
\[5]And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
\[6](For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
\[7]Then all of you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.
\[8]And it shall be, when all of you have taken the city, that all of you shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall all of you do. See, I have commanded you.
\[9]Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
\[10]And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
\[11]And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.
\[12]And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
\[13]And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their hidden attackers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
\[14]And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knows not that there were hidden attackers in ambush against him behind the city.
\[15]And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
\[16]And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
\[17]And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
\[18]And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into yours hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.
\[19]And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.
\[20]And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
\[21]And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
\[22]And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they stroke them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
\[23]And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
\[24]And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and stroke it with the edge of the sword.
\[25]And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
\[26]For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
\[27]Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
\[28]And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.
\[29]And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remains unto this day.
\[30]Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
\[31]As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.
\[32]And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
\[33]And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them opposite to mount Gerizim, and half of them opposite to mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
\[34]And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
\[35]There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

nd it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea opposite to Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
\[2]That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
\[3]And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
\[4]They did work cunningly, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
\[5]And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.
\[6]And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make all of you a league with us.
\[7]And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Possibly all of you dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
\[8]And they said unto Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are all of you? and from whence come all of you?
\[9]And they said unto him, From a very far country your servants are come because of the name of the LORD your God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
\[10]And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.
\[11]Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make all of you a league with us.
\[12]This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:
\[13]And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
\[14]And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.
\[15]And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore unto them.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.
\[17]And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.
\[18]And the children of Israel stroke them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
\[19]But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
\[20]This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore unto them.
\[21]And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
\[22]And Joshua called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying, Wherefore have all of you misled us, saying, We are very far from you; when all of you dwell among us?
\[23]Now therefore all of you are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
\[24]And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told your servants, how that the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
\[25]And now, behold, we are in yours hand: as it seems good and right unto you to do unto us, do.
\[26]And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
\[27]And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

ow it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
\[2]That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
\[3]Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\[4]Come up unto me, and help me, that we may strike Gibeon: for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
\[5]Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
\[6]And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
\[7]So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
\[8]And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into yours hand; there shall not a man of them stand before you.
\[9]Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.
\[10]And the LORD humiliated them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and stroke them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
\[11]And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
\[12]Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still upon Gibeon; and you, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
\[13]And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
\[14]And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.
\[15]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
\[16]But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
\[17]And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
\[18]And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it in order to keep them:
\[19]And stay all of you not, but pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.
\[20]And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.
\[21]And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
\[22]Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.
\[23]And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
\[24]And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
\[25]And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom all of you fight.
\[26]And afterward Joshua stroke them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
\[27]And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.
\[28]And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and stroke it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.
\[29]Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
\[30]And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he stroke it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.
\[31]And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
\[32]And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and stroke it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
\[33]Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua stroke him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
\[34]And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
\[35]And they took it on that day, and stroke it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
\[36]And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
\[37]And they took it, and stroke it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
\[38]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
\[39]And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they stroke them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
\[40]So Joshua stroke all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
\[41]And Joshua stroke them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
\[42]And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at the same, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
\[43]And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.

nd it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
\[2]And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,
\[3]And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
\[4]And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
\[5]And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
\[6]And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: in order to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: you shall cut the hamstrings of their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
\[7]So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
\[8]And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who stroke them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they stroke them, until they left them none remaining.
\[9]And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he cut the hamstrings of their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
\[10]And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and stroke the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor in time past was the head of all those kingdoms.
\[11]And they stroke all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
\[12]And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and stroke them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
\[13]But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
\[14]And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they stroke with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
\[15]As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
\[16]So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
\[17]Even from the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and stroke them, and slew them.
\[18]Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
\[19]There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
\[20]For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\[21]And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
\[22]There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
\[23]So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

ow Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, You are old and stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.
\[2]This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
\[3]From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
\[4]From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:
\[5]And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
\[6]All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide you it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
\[7]Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
\[8]With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;
\[9]From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
\[10]And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
\[11]And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;
\[12]All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses strike, and cast them out.
\[13]Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
\[14]Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.
\[15]And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.
\[16]And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;
\[17]Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,
\[18]And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
\[19]And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,
\[20]And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,
\[21]And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses stroke with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
\[22]Balaam also the son of Beor, the fortune teller, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.
\[23]And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
\[24]And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families.
\[25]And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
\[26]And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
\[27]And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.
\[28]This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
\[29]And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
\[30]And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
\[31]And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
\[32]These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.
\[33]But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.

nd these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
\[2]By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.
\[3]For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
\[4]For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
\[5]As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
\[6]Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, You know the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.
\[7]Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to monitor out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.
\[8]Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
\[9]And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon your feet have trodden shall be yours inheritance, and your children's for ever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.
\[10]And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
\[11]As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
\[12]Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.
\[13]And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
\[14]Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.
\[15]And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

\[3]And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:
\[4]From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the activities out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.

\[9]And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:

\[12]And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
\[13]And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.
\[14]And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
\[15]And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.
\[16]And Caleb said, He that strikes Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
\[17]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
\[18]And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What would you?
\[19]Who answered, Give me a blessing; for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

here was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to know, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
\[2]There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
\[3]But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
\[4]And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
\[5]And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;
\[6]Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
\[7]And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lies before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.
\[8]Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
\[9]And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the utmost limit of it were at the sea:
\[10]Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
\[11]And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.
\[12]Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[13]Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were becoming strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.
\[14]And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying, Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD has blessed me until now?
\[15]And Joshua answered them, If you be a great people, then get you up to the wood country, and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for you.
\[16]And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
\[17]And Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power: you shall not have one lot only:
\[18]But the mountain shall be yours; for it is a wood, and you shall cut it down: and the utmost limit of it shall be yours: for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

\[4]Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.
\[5]And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.
\[6]All of you shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
\[7]But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.

\[30]Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.
\[31]This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
\[32]The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
\[33]And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the utmost limit thereof were at Jordan:
\[34]And then the coast turns westward to Aznothtabor, and goes out from thence to Hukkok, and reachs to Zebulun on the south side, and reachs to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.
\[35]And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
\[36]And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
\[37]And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,
\[38]And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
\[39]This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.
\[40]And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
\[41]And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,
\[42]And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,
\[43]And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,
\[44]And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,
\[45]And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,
\[46]And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.
\[47]And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and stroke it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
\[48]This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
\[49]When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:
\[50]According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
\[51]These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.

he LORD also spoke unto Joshua, saying,
\[2]Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spoke unto you by the hand of Moses:
\[3]That the slayer that kills any person unexpectedly and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
\[4]And when he that does flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
\[5]And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he stroke his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not in time past.
\[6]And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
\[7]And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.
\[8]And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
\[9]These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourns among them, that whosoever kills any person at unexpectedly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

hen came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
\[2]And they spoke unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
\[3]And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.
\[4]And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
\[5]And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
\[6]And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
\[7]The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
\[8]And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
\[9]And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.
\[10]Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.
\[11]And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
\[12]But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
\[13]Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,
\[14]And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,
\[15]And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,
\[16]And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
\[17]And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,
\[18]Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.
\[19]All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\[20]And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
\[21]For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,
\[22]And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities.
\[23]And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,
\[24]Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities.
\[25]And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.
\[26]All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
\[27]And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.
\[28]And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,
\[29]Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities.
\[30]And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,
\[31]Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.
\[32]And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.
\[33]All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
\[34]And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,
\[35]Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.
\[36]And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,
\[37]Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.
\[38]And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,
\[39]Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.
\[40]So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.
\[41]All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
\[42]These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities.
\[43]And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he swore to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
\[44]And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
\[45]There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

hen Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
\[2]And said unto them, All of you have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:
\[3]All of you have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
\[4]And now the LORD your God has given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return all of you, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.
\[5]But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\[6]So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.
\[7]Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,
\[8]And he spoke unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
\[9]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[10]And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.
\[11]And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar opposite to the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
\[12]And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
\[13]And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
\[14]And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
\[15]And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
\[16]Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that all of you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that all of you have built you an altar, that all of you might rebel this day against the LORD?
\[17]Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,
\[18]But that all of you must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing all of you rebel to day against the LORD, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
\[19]Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass all of you over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.
\[20]Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
\[21]Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
\[22]The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knows, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)
\[23]That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or food offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;
\[24]And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have all of you to do with the LORD God of Israel?
\[25]For the LORD has made Jordan a border between us and you, all of you children of Reuben and children of Gad; all of you have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
\[26]Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
\[27]But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, All of you have no part in the LORD.
\[28]Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.
\[29]God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for food offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.
\[30]And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
\[31]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because all of you have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now all of you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
\[32]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
\[33]And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
\[34]And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.

nd it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.
\[2]And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:
\[3]And all of you have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that has fought for you.
\[4]Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.
\[5]And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and all of you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God has promised unto you.
\[6]Be all of you therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that all of you turn not aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
\[7]That all of you come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:
\[8]But cleave unto the LORD your God, as all of you have done unto this day.
\[9]For the LORD has driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man has been able to stand before you unto this day.
\[10]One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fights for you, as he has promised you.
\[11]Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that all of you love the LORD your God.
\[12]Else if all of you do in any way go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:
\[13]Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until all of you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
\[14]And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and all of you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing has failed thereof.
\[15]Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.
\[16]When all of you have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and all of you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given unto you.

nd Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
\[2]And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.
\[3]And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
\[4]And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
\[5]I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
\[6]And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and all of you came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
\[7]And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and all of you dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
\[8]And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that all of you might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
\[9]Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
\[10]But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
\[11]And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
\[12]And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with your sword, nor with your bow.
\[13]And I have given you a land for which all of you did not labour, and cities which all of you built not, and all of you dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive yards which all of you planted not do all of you eat.
\[14]Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve all of you the LORD.
\[15]And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom all of you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land all of you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
\[16]And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
\[17]For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
\[18]And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.
\[19]And Joshua said unto the people, All of you cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
\[20]If all of you forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he has done you good.
\[21]And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.
\[22]And Joshua said unto the people, All of you are witnesses against yourselves that all of you have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
\[23]Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.
\[24]And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
\[25]So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
\[26]And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
\[27]And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest all of you deny your God.
\[28]So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
\[29]And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
\[30]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
\[31]And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that survived after Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.
\[32]And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
\[33]And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

ow after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
\[2]And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
\[3]And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with him.
\[4]And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
\[5]And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
\[6]But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
\[7]And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
\[8]Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
\[9]And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
\[10]And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
\[11]And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:
\[12]And Caleb said, He that strikes Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
\[13]And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
\[14]And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What will you?
\[15]And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
\[16]And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
\[17]And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
\[18]Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
\[19]And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
\[20]And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
\[22]And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.
\[23]And the house of Joseph sent to search out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)
\[24]And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy.
\[25]And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they stroke the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
\[26]And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.
\[27]Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\[28]And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
\[29]Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
\[30]Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
\[31]Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
\[32]But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
\[33]Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
\[34]And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
\[35]But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
\[36]And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

nd an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
\[2]And all of you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; all of you shall throw down their altars: but all of you have not obeyed my voice: why have all of you done this?
\[3]Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
\[4]And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[5]And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.
\[6]And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
\[7]And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.
\[8]And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
\[9]And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
\[10]And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
\[11]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:
\[12]And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
\[13]And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
\[14]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\[15]Anywhere they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
\[16]Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
\[17]And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.
\[18]And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
\[19]And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\[20]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
\[21]I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
\[22]That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
\[23]Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

ow these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
\[2]Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
\[3]Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
\[4]And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
\[5]And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
\[6]And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
\[7]And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgotten about the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
\[8]Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.
\[9]And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
\[10]And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
\[11]And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
\[12]And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[13]And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and stroke Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
\[14]So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
\[15]But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
\[16]But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
\[17]And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
\[18]And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
\[19]But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
\[20]And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto you. And he arose out of his seat.
\[21]And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
\[22]And the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
\[23]Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
\[24]When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covers his feet in his summer chamber.
\[25]And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
\[26]And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
\[27]And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
\[28]And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
\[29]And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
\[30]So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
\[31]And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.

\[2]And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\[3]And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
\[4]And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
\[5]And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
\[6]And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
\[7]And I will draw unto you to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into yours hand.
\[8]And Barak said unto her, If you will go with me, then I will go: but if you will not go with me, then I will not go.
\[9]And she said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding the journey that you take shall not be for yours honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\[10]And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
\[11]Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
\[12]And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
\[13]And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
\[14]And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into yours hand: is not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
\[15]And the LORD humiliated Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
\[16]But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
\[17]Nevertheless Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\[18]And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
\[19]And he said unto her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
\[20]Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and enquire of you, and say, Is there any man here? that you shall say, No.
\[21]Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and stroke the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
\[22]And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.
\[23]So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
\[24]And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

\[2]Praise all of you the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
\[3]Hear, O all of you kings; give ear, O all of you princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.
\[4]LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
\[5]The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.
\[6]In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.
\[7]The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
\[8]They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
\[9]My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless all of you the LORD.
\[10]Speak, all of you that ride on white asses, all of you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
\[11]They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
\[12]Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.
\[13]Then he made him that remains have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
\[14]Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, among your people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
\[15]And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.
\[16]Why abode you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
\[17]Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.
\[18]Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeopardized their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
\[19]The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
\[20]They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
\[21]The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, you have trodden down strength.
\[22]Then were the horse-hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.
\[23]Curse all of you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse all of you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
\[24]Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
\[25]He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
\[26]She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she stroke Sisera, she stroke off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
\[27]At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
\[28]The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
\[29]Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,
\[30]Have they not succeeded? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?
\[31]So let all yours enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.

nd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\[2]And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
\[3]And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
\[4]And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till you come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
\[5]For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
\[6]And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,
\[8]That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
\[9]And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
\[10]And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land all of you dwell: but all of you have not obeyed my voice.
\[11]And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
\[12]And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valour.
\[13]And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD has forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
\[14]And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this your might, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent you?
\[15]And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
\[16]And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.
\[17]And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in your sight, then show me a sign that you talk with me.
\[18]Depart not behind, I pray you, until I come unto you, and bring forth my present, and set it before you. And he said, I will tarry until you come again.
\[19]And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
\[20]And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
\[21]Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.
\[22]And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.
\[23]And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto you; fear not: you shall not die.
\[24]Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\[25]And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:
\[26]And build an altar unto the LORD your God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you shall cut down.
\[27]Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
\[28]And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
\[29]And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.
\[30]Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die: because he has cast down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the grove that was by it.
\[31]And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will all of you plead for Baal? will all of you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar.
\[32]Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar.
\[33]Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
\[34]But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.
\[35]And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
\[36]And Gideon said unto God, If you will save Israel by mine hand, as you have said,
\[37]Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that you will save Israel by mine hand, as you have said.
\[38]And it was so: for he rose up early on the next day, and thrust the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
\[39]And Gideon said unto God, Let not yours anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
\[40]And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

hen Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
\[2]And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand has saved me.
\[3]Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
\[4]And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomsoever I say unto you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.
\[5]So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise every one that bows down upon his knees to drink.
\[6]And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
\[7]And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into yours hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.
\[8]So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
\[9]And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get you down unto the host; for I have delivered it into yours hand.
\[10]But if you fear to go down, go you with Phurah your servant down to the host:
\[11]And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall yours hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
\[12]And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
\[13]And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and stroke it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.
\[14]And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host.
\[15]And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
\[16]And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
\[17]And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall all of you do.
\[18]When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow all of you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
\[19]So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.
\[20]And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow likewise: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
\[21]And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
\[22]And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.
\[23]And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
\[24]And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.
\[25]And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

\[3]God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was decreased toward him, when he had said that.
\[4]And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.
\[5]And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
\[6]And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in yours hand, that we should give bread unto yours army?
\[7]And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
\[8]And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
\[9]And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
\[10]Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
\[11]And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and stroke the host; for the host was secure.
\[12]And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and humiliated all the host.
\[13]And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,
\[14]And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.
\[15]And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom all of you did reproach me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in yours hand, that we should give bread unto your men that are weary?
\[16]And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
\[17]And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
\[18]Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom all of you slew at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
\[19]And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD lives, if all of you had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
\[20]And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
\[21]Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
\[22]Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son also: for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.
\[23]And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
\[24]And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that all of you would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
\[25]And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.
\[26]And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.
\[27]And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
\[28]Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
\[29]And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
\[30]And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
\[31]And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
\[32]And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\[33]And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.
\[34]And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:
\[35]Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel.

nd Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
\[2]Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
\[3]And his mother's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
\[4]And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.
\[5]And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
\[6]And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
\[7]And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, all of you men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
\[8]The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign you over us.
\[9]But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[10]And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.
\[11]But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[12]Then said the trees unto the vine, Come you, and reign over us.
\[13]And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
\[14]Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.
\[15]And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth all of you anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
\[16]Now therefore, if all of you have done truly and sincerely, in that all of you have made Abimelech king, and if all of you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;
\[17](For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
\[18]And all of you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
\[19]If all of you then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice all of you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
\[20]But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
\[21]And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
\[22]When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
\[23]Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
\[24]That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.
\[25]And the men of Shechem set hidden attackers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
\[26]And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
\[27]And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
\[28]And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
\[29]And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase yours army, and come out.
\[30]And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
\[31]And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against you.
\[32]Now therefore up by night, you and the people that is with you, and lie in wait in the field:
\[33]And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.
\[34]And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
\[35]And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.
\[36]And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
\[37]And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
\[38]Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now your mouth, wherewith you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
\[39]And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
\[40]And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.
\[41]And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
\[42]And it came to pass on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
\[43]And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and stroke them.
\[44]And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.
\[45]And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\[46]And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
\[47]And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
\[48]And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What all of you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
\[49]And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\[50]Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
\[51]But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and got them up to the top of the tower.
\[52]And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
\[53]And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.
\[54]Then he called hastily unto the young man his armour bearer, and said unto him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\[55]And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
\[56]Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
\[57]And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

nd after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
\[2]And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
\[3]And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.
\[4]And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
\[5]And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
\[6]And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.
\[7]And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.
\[8]And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
\[9]Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
\[10]And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against you, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.
\[11]And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\[12]The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and all of you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
\[13]Yet all of you have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.
\[14]Go and cry unto the gods which all of you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
\[15]And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do you unto us whatsoever seems good unto you; deliver us only, we pray you, this day.
\[16]And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
\[17]Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.
\[18]And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

ow Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead brings forth Jephthah.
\[2]And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of a strange woman.
\[3]Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.
\[4]And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
\[5]And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
\[6]And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
\[7]And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not all of you hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are all of you come unto me now when all of you are in distress?
\[8]And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we return to you now, that you may go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
\[9]And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If all of you bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
\[10]And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to your words.
\[11]Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.
\[12]And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?
\[13]And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
\[14]And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:
\[15]And said unto him, Thus says Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
\[16]But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
\[17]Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
\[18]Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
\[19]And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land into my place.
\[20]But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\[21]And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they stroke them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\[22]And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.
\[23]So now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess it?
\[24]Will not you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
\[25]And now are you any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
\[26]While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did all of you not recover them within that time?
\[27]Wherefore I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
\[28]Nevertheless the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
\[29]Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
\[30]And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
\[31]Then it shall be, that whatsoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
\[32]So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
\[33]And he stroke them from Aroer, even till you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
\[34]And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
\[35]And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.
\[36]And she said unto him, My father, if you have opened your mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth; forasmuch as the LORD has taken vengeance for you of yours enemies, even of the children of Ammon.
\[37]And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and mourn for my virginity, I and my fellows.
\[38]And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,
\[40]That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

\[2]And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, all of you delivered me not out of their hands.
\[3]And when I saw that all of you delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed opposite to the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are all of you come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
\[4]Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead stroke Ephraim, because they said, All of you Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.
\[5]And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
\[6]Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.

nd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
\[2]And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
\[3]And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, you are barren, and bear not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son.
\[4]Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
\[5]For, lo, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[6]Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
\[7]But he said unto me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
\[8]Then Manoah implored the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which you did send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
\[9]And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
\[10]And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man has appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.
\[11]And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Are you the man that spoke unto the woman? And he said, I am.
\[12]And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?
\[13]And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
\[14]She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.
\[15]And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.
\[16]And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread: and if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.
\[17]And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is your name, that when your sayings come to pass we may do you honour?
\[18]And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is secret?
\[19]So Manoah took a kid with a food offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.
\[20]For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.
\[21]But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.
\[22]And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
\[23]But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a food offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.
\[24]And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.
\[25]And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

nd Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
\[2]And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
\[3]Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there not a woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well.
\[4]But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
\[5]Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
\[6]And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
\[7]And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
\[8]And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.
\[9]And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
\[10]So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
\[11]And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
\[12]And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if all of you can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:
\[13]But if all of you cannot declare it me, then shall all of you give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.
\[14]And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
\[15]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have all of you called us to take that we have? is it not so?
\[16]And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and love me not: you have put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and have not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it you?
\[17]And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
\[18]And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If all of you had not plowed with my heifer, all of you had not found out my riddle.
\[19]And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
\[20]But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.

ut it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
\[2]And her father said, I verily thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray you, instead of her.
\[3]And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.
\[4]And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.
\[5]And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
\[6]Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
\[7]And Samson said unto them, Though all of you have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
\[8]And he stroke them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
\[9]Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
\[10]And the men of Judah said, Why are all of you come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he has done to us.
\[11]Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Know you not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that you have done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
\[12]And they said unto him, We are come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that all of you will not fall upon me yourselves.
\[13]And they spoke unto him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
\[14]And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.
\[15]And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
\[16]And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
\[17]And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.
\[18]And he was sore thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, You have given this great deliverance into the hand of your servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
\[19]But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water from it; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.
\[20]And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

hen went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.
\[2]And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson has come here. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.
\[3]And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.
\[4]And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
\[5]And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give you every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
\[6]And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray you, wherein your great strength lies, and wherewith you might be bound to afflict you.
\[7]And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\[8]Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
\[9]Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a thread of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known.
\[10]And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray you, wherewith you might be bound.
\[11]And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
\[12]Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And there were hidden attackers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.
\[13]And Delilah said unto Samson, Until now you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith you might be bound. And he said unto her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web.
\[14]And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
\[15]And she said unto him, How can you say, I love you, when yours heart is not with me? you have mocked me these three times, and have not told me wherein your great strength lies.
\[16]And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;
\[17]That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There has not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
\[18]And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.
\[19]And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
\[20]And she said, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knows not that the LORD was departed from him.
\[21]But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.
\[22]Nevertheless the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
\[23]Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together in order to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
\[24]And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.
\[25]And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
\[26]And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house stands, that I may lean upon them.
\[27]Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
\[28]And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray you, and strengthen me, I pray you, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
\[29]And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
\[30]And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.
\[31]Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

nd there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
\[2]And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my son.
\[3]And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto you.
\[4]Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.
\[5]And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
\[6]In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
\[7]And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
\[8]And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
\[9]And Micah said unto him, Whence come you? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
\[10]And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.
\[11]And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
\[12]And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
\[13]Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

n those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
\[2]And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
\[3]When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought you here? and what make you in this place? and what have you here?
\[4]And he said unto them, Thus and thus deals Micah with me, and has hired me, and I am his priest.
\[5]And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
\[6]And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein all of you go.
\[7]Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
\[8]And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say all of you?
\[9]And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are all of you still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
\[10]When all of you go, all of you shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no lack of any thing that is in the earth.
\[11]And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
\[12]And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.
\[13]And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
\[14]Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do all of you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what all of you have to do.
\[15]And they turned in that direction, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.
\[16]And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.
\[17]And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.
\[18]And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do all of you?
\[19]And they said unto him, Hold your peace, lay yours hand upon your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that you be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
\[20]And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
\[21]So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
\[22]And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
\[23]And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What disturbs you, that you come with such a company?
\[24]And he said, All of you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and all of you are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that all of you say unto me, What disturbs you?
\[25]And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.
\[26]And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
\[27]And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were resting and secure: and they stroke them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
\[28]And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.
\[29]And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: nevertheless the name of the city was Laish at the first.
\[30]And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
\[31]And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

nd it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.
\[2]And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.
\[3]And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
\[4]And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
\[5]And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort yours heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
\[6]And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray you, and tarry all night, and let yours heart be merry.
\[7]And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
\[8]And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort yours heart, I pray you. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
\[9]And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that yours heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.
\[10]But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came opposite to Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
\[11]And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
\[12]And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside here into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
\[13]And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
\[14]And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
\[15]And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.
\[16]And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.
\[17]And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a travelling man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Where go you? and whence come you?
\[18]And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receives me to house.
\[19]Yet there is both straw and animal food for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man which is with your servants: there is no lack of any thing.
\[20]And the old man said, Peace be with you; howsoever let all your wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
\[21]So he brought him into his house, and gave animal food unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
\[22]Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into yours house, that we may know him.
\[23]And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man has come into mine house, do not this folly.
\[24]Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble all of you them, and do with them what seems good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.
\[25]But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they had sexual contact with her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
\[26]Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
\[27]And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.
\[28]And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and got him unto his place.
\[29]And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.
\[30]And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.

\[2]And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
\[3](Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?
\[4]And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\[5]And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
\[6]And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
\[7]Behold, all of you are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
\[8]And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.
\[9]But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;
\[10]And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
\[11]So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
\[12]And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
\[13]Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
\[14]But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
\[15]And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
\[16]Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.
\[17]And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
\[18]And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.
\[19]And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
\[20]And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
\[21]And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
\[22]And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
\[23](And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)
\[24]And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
\[25]And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
\[26]Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
\[27]And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\[28]And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; in order to morrow I will deliver them into yours hand.
\[29]And Israel set hidden attackers in wait round about Gibeah.
\[30]And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
\[31]And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
\[32]And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.
\[33]And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the hidden attackers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.
\[34]And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.
\[35]And the LORD stroke Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.
\[36]So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the hidden attackers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
\[37]And the hidden attackers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the hidden attackers in wait drew themselves along, and stroke all the city with the edge of the sword.
\[38]Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the hidden attackers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.
\[39]And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
\[40]But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
\[41]And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.
\[42]Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
\[43]Thus they enclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease opposite to Gibeah toward the sunrising.
\[44]And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.
\[45]And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
\[46]So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
\[47]But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
\[48]And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and stroke them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

ow the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
\[2]And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;
\[3]And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?
\[4]And it came to pass on the next day, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
\[5]And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
\[6]And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
\[7]How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
\[8]And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
\[9]For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
\[10]And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
\[11]And this is the thing that all of you shall do, All of you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that has lain by man.
\[12]And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
\[13]And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.
\[14]And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
\[15]And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\[16]Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
\[17]And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
\[18]Nevertheless we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that gives a wife to Benjamin.
\[19]Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
\[20]Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
\[21]And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come all of you out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
\[22]And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for all of you did not give unto them at this time, that all of you should be guilty.
\[23]And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
\[24]And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
\[25]In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

ow it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
\[2]And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
\[3]And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
\[4]And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
\[5]And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
\[6]Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
\[7]Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
\[8]And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as all of you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
\[9]The LORD grant you that all of you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
\[10]And they said unto her, Surely we will return with you unto your people.
\[11]And Naomi said, Return, my daughters: why will all of you go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
\[12]Return, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
\[13]Would all of you tarry for them till they were grown? would all of you stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieves me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
\[14]And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
\[15]And she said, Behold, your sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return you after your sister in law.
\[16]And Ruth said, Implore me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:
\[17]Where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part you and me.
\[18]When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
\[19]So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
\[20]And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
\[21]I went out full and the LORD has brought me home again empty: why then call all of you me Naomi, seeing the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?
\[22]So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

nd Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
\[2]And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
\[3]And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
\[4]And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless you.
\[5]Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
\[6]And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
\[7]And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
\[8]Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hear you not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from behind, but abide here fast by my maidens:
\[9]Let yours eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go you after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
\[10]Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in yours eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
\[11]And Boaz answered and said unto her, It has fully been showed me, all that you have done unto your mother in law since the death of yours husband: and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and are come unto a people which you knew not in time past.
\[12]The LORD recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to trust.
\[13]Then she said, Let me find favour in your sight, my lord; for that you have comforted me, and for that you have spoken friendly unto yours handmaid, though I be not like unto one of yours handmaidens.
\[14]And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come you here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
\[15]And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
\[16]And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
\[17]So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
\[18]And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
\[19]And her mother in law said unto her, Where have you gleaned to day? and where wrought you? blessed be he that did take knowledge of you. And she showed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.
\[20]And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
\[21]And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
\[22]And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, that they meet you not in any other field.
\[23]So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.

hen Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
\[2]And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley to night in the threshing floor.
\[3]Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your raiment upon you, and get you down to the floor: but make not yourself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
\[4]And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
\[5]And she said unto her, All that you says unto me I will do.
\[6]And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
\[7]And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
\[8]And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
\[9]And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth yours handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over yours handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.
\[10]And he said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my daughter: for you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you followed not young men, whether poor or rich.
\[11]And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman.
\[12]And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I.
\[13]Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.
\[14]And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
\[15]Also he said, Bring the vail that you have upon you, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.
\[16]And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
\[17]And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto your mother in law.
\[18]Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.

hen went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
\[2]And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit all of you down here. And they sat down.
\[3]And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:
\[4]And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.
\[5]Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
\[6]And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin mine own inheritance: redeem you my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem it.
\[7]Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, in order to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.
\[8]Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for you. So he drew off his shoe.
\[9]And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, All of you are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
\[10]Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: all of you are witnesses this day.
\[11]And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that has come into yours house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do you worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
\[12]And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman.
\[13]So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.
\[14]And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which has not left you this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
\[15]And he shall be unto you a restorer of your life, and a nourisher of yours old age: for your daughter in law, which loves you, which is better to you than seven sons, has born him.
\[16]And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
\[17]And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
\[18]Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez brings forth Hezron,
\[19]And Hezron brings forth Ram, and Ram brings forth Amminadab,
\[20]And Amminadab brings forth Nahshon, and Nahshon brings forth Salmon,
\[21]And Salmon brings forth Boaz, and Boaz brings forth Obed,
\[22]And Obed brings forth Jesse, and Jesse brings forth David.

ow there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
\[2]And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\[3]And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.
\[4]And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
\[5]But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.
\[6]And her adversary also provoked her sore, in order to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.
\[7]And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
\[8]Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why eat you not? and why is your heart grieved? am not I better to you than ten sons?
\[9]So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
\[10]And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.
\[11]And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of yours handmaid, and remember me, and not forget yours handmaid, but will give unto yours handmaid a male child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
\[12]And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.
\[13]Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
\[14]And Eli said unto her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.
\[15]And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
\[16]Count not yours handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken until now.
\[17]Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him.
\[18]And she said, Let yours handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
\[19]And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
\[20]Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.
\[21]And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
\[22]But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
\[23]And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seems you good; tarry until you have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
\[24]And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.
\[25]And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
\[26]And she said, Oh my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying unto the LORD.
\[27]For this child I prayed; and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him:
\[28]Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.

\[2]There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.
\[3]Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
\[4]The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
\[5]They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.
\[6]The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.
\[7]The LORD makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up.
\[8]He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he has set the world upon them.
\[9]He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
\[10]The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
\[11]And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
\[12]Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
\[13]And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;
\[14]And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
\[15]Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.
\[16]And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, Nay; but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
\[17]Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
\[18]But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
\[19]Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
\[20]And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give you seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.
\[21]And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
\[22]Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[23]And he said unto them, Why do all of you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
\[24]Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: all of you make the LORD's people to transgress.
\[25]If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall implore for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
\[26]And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
\[27]And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
\[28]And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of your father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
\[29]Wherefore kick all of you at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honour your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
\[30]Wherefore the LORD God of Israel says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD says, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
\[31]Behold, the days come, that I will cut off yours arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in yours house.
\[32]And you shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in yours house for ever.
\[33]And the man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume yours eyes, and to grieve yours heart: and all the increase of yours house shall die in the flower of their age.
\[34]And this shall be a sign unto you, that shall come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
\[35]And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
\[36]And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in yours house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

nd the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
\[2]And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
\[3]And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
\[4]That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
\[5]And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
\[6]And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
\[7]Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.
\[8]And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
\[9]Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, LORD; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\[10]And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for your servant hears.
\[11]And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.
\[12]In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
\[13]For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
\[14]And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
\[15]And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
\[16]Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
\[17]And he said, What is the thing that the LORD has said unto you? I pray you hide it not from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto you.
\[18]And Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seems him good.
\[19]And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
\[20]And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.
\[21]And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

nd the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
\[2]And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
\[3]And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore has the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
\[4]So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
\[5]And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
\[6]And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.
\[7]And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there has not been such a thing in time past.
\[8]Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that stroke the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
\[9]Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O all of you Philistines, that all of you be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
\[10]And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\[11]And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
\[12]And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
\[13]And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
\[14]And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
\[15]Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
\[16]And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
\[17]And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
\[18]And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
\[19]And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
\[20]And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for you have born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
\[21]And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
\[22]And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.

\[3]And when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
\[4]And when they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
\[5]Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
\[6]But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and stroke them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.
\[7]And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
\[8]They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.
\[9]And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he stroke the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
\[10]Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
\[11]So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

nd the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
\[2]And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.
\[3]And they said, If all of you send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any way return him a trespass offering: then all of you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
\[4]Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
\[5]Wherefore all of you shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that ruin the land; and all of you shall give glory unto the God of Israel: possibly he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
\[6]Wherefore then do all of you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
\[7]Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk giving cattle, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cattle to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
\[8]And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which all of you return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
\[9]And see, if it goes up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that stroke us: it was a chance that happened to us.
\[10]And the men did so; and took two milk giving cattle, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
\[11]And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
\[12]And the cattle took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.
\[13]And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
\[14]And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the cattle a burnt offering unto the LORD.
\[15]And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.
\[16]And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
\[17]And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
\[18]And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remains unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.
\[19]And he stroke the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he stroke of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.
\[20]And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
\[21]And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come all of you down, and fetch it up to you.

\[2]And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
\[3]And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying, If all of you do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[4]Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
\[5]And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.
\[6]And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
\[7]And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
\[8]And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
\[9]And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
\[10]And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and humiliated them; and they were smitten before Israel.
\[11]And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and stroke them, until they came under Bethcar.
\[12]Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Until now has the LORD helped us.
\[13]So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\[14]And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

\[16]And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

\[2]Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.
\[3]And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after illegal gain, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

\[5]And said unto him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.

\[8]According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto you.
\[9]Now therefore hearken unto their voice: nevertheless yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
\[10]And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.
\[11]And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.
\[12]And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
\[13]And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
\[14]And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
\[15]And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
\[16]And he will take your male servants, and your maidservants, and your best young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
\[17]He will take the tenth of your sheep: and all of you shall be his servants.
\[18]And all of you shall cry out in that day because of your king which all of you shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

\[20]That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

\[2]And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
\[3]And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the asses.
\[4]And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
\[5]And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.
\[6]And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he says comes surely to pass: now let us go thither; possibly he can show us our way that we should go.
\[7]Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
\[8]And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
\[9](in time past in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was in time past called a Seer.)
\[10]Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
\[11]And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
\[12]And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:
\[13]As soon as all of you be come into the city, all of you shall immediately find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he comes, because he does bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time all of you shall find him.
\[14]And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, in order to go up to the high place.
\[15]Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
\[16]Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come unto me.
\[17]And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spoke to you of! this same shall reign over my people.
\[18]Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.
\[19]And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for all of you shall eat with me to day, and tomorrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in yours heart.
\[20]And as for yours asses that were lost three days ago, set not your mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you, and on all your father's house?
\[21]And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speak you so to me?
\[22]And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.
\[23]And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said unto you, Set it by you.
\[24]And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before you, and eat: for unto this time has it been kept for you since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
\[25]And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
\[26]And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
\[27]And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand you still a while, that I may show you the word of God.

\[3]Then shall you go on forward from thence, and you shall come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
\[4]And they will salute you, and give you two loaves of bread; which you shall receive of their hands.
\[5]After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
\[6]And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
\[7]And let it be, when these signs are come unto you, that you do as occasion serve you; for God is with you.
\[8]And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.
\[9]And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
\[10]And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
\[11]And it came to pass, when all that knew him in time past saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that has come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[12]And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
\[13]And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.

\[15]And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray you, what Samuel said unto you.
\[16]And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spoke, he told him not.
\[17]And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
\[18]And said unto the children of Israel, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
\[19]And all of you have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and all of you have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.

\[21]When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
\[22]Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he has hid himself among the stuff.
\[23]And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
\[24]And Samuel said to all the people, See all of you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
\[25]Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
\[26]And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
\[27]But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.

hen Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.
\[2]And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
\[3]And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to you.
\[4]Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
\[5]And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What disturbs the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
\[6]And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
\[7]And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
\[8]And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
\[9]And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall all of you say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, Tomorrow, by that time the sun be hot, all of you shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
\[10]Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and all of you shall do with us all that seems good unto you.
\[11]And it was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
\[12]And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
\[13]And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: in order to day the LORD has wrought salvation in Israel.
\[14]Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
\[15]And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

nd Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that all of you said unto me, and have made a king over you.
\[2]And now, behold, the king walks before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
\[3]Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
\[4]And they said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken ought of any man's hand.
\[5]And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that all of you have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.
\[6]And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
\[7]Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
\[8]When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
\[9]And when they forgotten about the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
\[10]And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.
\[11]And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and all of you dwelled safe.
\[12]And when all of you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, all of you said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.
\[13]Now therefore behold the king whom all of you have chosen, and whom all of you have desired! and, behold, the LORD has set a king over you.
\[14]If all of you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both all of you and also the king that reigns over you continue following the LORD your God:
\[15]But if all of you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.
\[16]Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
\[17]Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that all of you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which all of you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
\[18]So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
\[19]And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for your servants unto the LORD your God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
\[20]And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: all of you have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
\[21]And turn all of you not aside: for then should all of you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
\[22]For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people.
\[23]Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
\[24]Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he has done for you.
\[25]But if all of you shall still do wickedly, all of you shall be consumed, both all of you and your king.

aul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
\[2]Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
\[3]And Jonathan stroke the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
\[4]And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
\[5]And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.
\[6]When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
\[7]And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
\[8]And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
\[9]And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
\[10]And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
\[11]And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you came not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;
\[12]Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
\[13]And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom upon Israel for ever.
\[14]But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be captain over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you.
\[15]And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
\[16]And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\[17]And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leads to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
\[18]And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looks to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
\[19]Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
\[20]But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.
\[21]Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
\[22]So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
\[23]And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

ow it came to pass on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.
\[2]And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
\[3]And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
\[4]And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\[5]The forefront of the one was situated northward opposite to Michmash, and the other southward opposite to Gibeah.
\[6]And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.
\[7]And his armour bearer said unto him, Do all that is in yours heart: turn you; behold, I am with you according to your heart.
\[8]Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
\[9]If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
\[10]But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.
\[11]And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
\[12]And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armour bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armour bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
\[13]And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armour bearer slew after him.
\[14]And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
\[15]And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
\[16]And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
\[17]Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armour bearer were not there.
\[18]And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
\[19]And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw yours hand.
\[20]And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
\[21]Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
\[22]Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
\[23]So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.
\[24]And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
\[25]And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
\[26]And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
\[27]But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
\[28]Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food this day. And the people were faint.
\[29]Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
\[30]How much more, if lest by any means the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
\[31]And they stroke the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
\[32]And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.
\[33]Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, All of you have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
\[34]And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
\[35]And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.
\[36]And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seems good unto you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here unto God.
\[37]And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
\[38]And Saul said, Draw all of you near here, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin has been this day.
\[39]For, as the LORD lives, which saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
\[40]Then said he unto all Israel, Be all of you on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seems good unto you.
\[41]Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
\[42]And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
\[43]Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.
\[44]And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.
\[45]And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
\[46]Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
\[47]So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and anywhere he turned himself, he vexed them.
\[48]And he gathered an host, and stroke the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
\[49]Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
\[50]And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
\[51]And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
\[52]And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.

amuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken you unto the voice of the words of the LORD.
\[2]Thus says the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
\[3]Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and nursing infant, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
\[4]And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
\[5]And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
\[6]And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for all of you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\[7]And Saul stroke the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is opposite to Egypt.
\[8]And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\[9]But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
\[10]Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,
\[11]It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.
\[12]And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
\[13]And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be you of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
\[14]And Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\[15]And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\[16]Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
\[17]And Samuel said, When you were little in yours own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?
\[18]And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
\[19]Wherefore then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did fly upon the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?
\[20]And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\[21]But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD your God in Gilgal.
\[22]And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
\[23]For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.
\[24]And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\[25]Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.
\[26]And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.
\[27]And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
\[28]And Samuel said unto him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbour of yours, that is better than you.
\[29]And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
\[30]Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.
\[31]So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
\[32]Then said Samuel, Bring all of you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
\[33]And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
\[34]Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
\[35]And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

nd the LORD said unto Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill yours horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
\[2]And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
\[3]And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint unto me him whom I name unto you.
\[4]And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Come you peaceably?
\[5]And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
\[6]And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.
\[7]But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.
\[8]Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this.
\[9]Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this.
\[10]Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD has not chosen these.
\[11]And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he comes here.
\[12]And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was rosy, and likewise of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
\[13]Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
\[14]But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
\[15]And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.
\[16]Let our lord now command your servants, which are before you, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.
\[17]And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
\[18]Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.
\[19]Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, which is with the sheep.
\[20]And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
\[21]And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour bearer.
\[22]And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me; for he has found favour in my sight.
\[23]And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

ow the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
\[2]And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\[3]And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
\[4]And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
\[5]And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of armour formed by chains; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
\[6]And he had protective leg armor of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
\[7]And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
\[8]And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are all of you come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and all of you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
\[9]If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall all of you be our servants, and serve us.
\[10]And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
\[11]When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\[12]Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
\[13]And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\[14]And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
\[15]But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
\[16]And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
\[17]And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for your brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brethren;
\[18]And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how your brethren fare, and take their pledge.
\[19]Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\[20]And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
\[21]For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
\[22]And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
\[23]And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.
\[24]And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
\[25]And the men of Israel said, Have all of you seen this man that has come up? surely to defy Israel is he comes up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
\[26]And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
\[27]And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him.
\[28]And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of yours heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle.
\[29]And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
\[30]And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
\[31]And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
\[32]And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
\[33]And Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
\[34]And David said unto Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
\[35]And I went out after him, and stroke him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and stroke him, and slew him.
\[36]Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.
\[37]David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with you.
\[38]And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of armour formed by chains.
\[39]And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
\[40]And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a pouch; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
\[41]And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
\[42]And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and rosy, and of a fair countenance.
\[43]And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\[44]And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
\[45]Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
\[46]This day will the LORD deliver you into mine hand; and I will strike you, and take yours head from you; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
\[47]And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.
\[48]And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
\[49]And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and stroke the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
\[50]So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and stroke the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
\[51]Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
\[52]And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
\[53]And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
\[54]And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.
\[55]And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.
\[56]And the king said, Enquire you whose son the teenager is.
\[57]And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\[58]And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

nd it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
\[2]And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
\[3]Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
\[4]And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
\[5]And David went out anywhere Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
\[6]And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.
\[7]And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
\[8]And Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
\[9]And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
\[10]And it came to pass on the next day, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
\[11]And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will strike David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
\[12]And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.
\[13]Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
\[14]And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
\[15]Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
\[16]But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
\[17]And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
\[18]And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?
\[19]But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
\[20]And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
\[21]And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son in law in the one of the two.
\[22]And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son in law.
\[23]And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
\[24]And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
\[25]And Saul said, Thus shall all of you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\[26]And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.
\[27]Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
\[28]And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.
\[29]And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
\[30]Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

nd Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
\[2]But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:
\[3]And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will commune with my father of you; and what I see, that I will tell you.
\[4]And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been toward you very good:
\[5]For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: you saw it, and did rejoice: wherefore then will you sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
\[6]And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the LORD lives, he shall not be slain.
\[7]And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
\[8]And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
\[9]And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.
\[10]And Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he stroke the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
\[11]Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, tomorrow you shall be slain.
\[12]So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
\[13]And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
\[14]And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
\[15]And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
\[16]And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.
\[17]And Saul said unto Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill you?
\[18]So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
\[19]And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
\[20]And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
\[21]And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
\[22]Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.
\[23]And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
\[24]And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

nd David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?
\[2]And he said unto him, God forbid; you shall not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
\[3]And David swore moreover, and said, Your father certainly knows that I have found grace in yours eyes; and he says, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.
\[4]Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.
\[5]And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at food: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
\[6]If your father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
\[7]If he say thus, It is well; your servant shall have peace: but if he be very angry, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
\[8]Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?
\[9]And Jonathan said, Far be it from you: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon you, then would not I tell it you?
\[10]Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if your father answer you roughly?
\[11]And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
\[12]And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto you, and show it you;
\[13]The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.
\[14]And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:
\[15]But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
\[16]So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
\[17]And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
\[18]Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.
\[19]And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.
\[20]And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
\[21]And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as the LORD lives.
\[22]But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away.
\[23]And as concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between you and me for ever.
\[24]So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.
\[25]And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
\[26]Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
\[27]And it came to pass on the next day, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore comes not the son of Jesse to food, neither yesterday, nor to day?
\[28]And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
\[29]And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in yours eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brethren. Therefore he comes not unto the king's table.
\[30]Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to yours own confusion, and unto the confusion of your mother's nakedness?
\[31]For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
\[32]And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what has he done?
\[33]And Saul cast a javelin at him to strike him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
\[34]So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
\[35]And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
\[36]And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
\[37]And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?
\[38]And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
\[39]But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
\[40]And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
\[41]And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
\[42]And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

hen came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?
\[2]And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabouts I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
\[3]Now therefore what is under yours hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.
\[4]And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
\[5]And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Truthfully women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
\[6]So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
\[7]Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
\[8]And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under yours hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
\[9]And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
\[10]And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
\[11]And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[12]And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
\[13]And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scratch on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
\[14]Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, all of you see the man is mad: wherefore then have all of you brought him to me?
\[15]Have I need of mad men, that all of you have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

avid therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
\[2]And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
\[3]And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
\[4]And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
\[5]And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
\[6]When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
\[7]Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, all of you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
\[8]That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\[9]Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
\[10]And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\[11]Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
\[12]And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
\[13]And Saul said unto him, Why have all of you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\[14]Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goes at your bidding, and is honourable in yours house?
\[15]Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for your servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
\[16]And the king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father's house.
\[17]And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
\[18]And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
\[19]And Nob, the city of the priests, stroke he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\[20]And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
\[21]And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.
\[22]And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.
\[23]Abide you with me, fear not: for he that seeks my life seeks your life: but with me you shall be in safeguard.

hen they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.
\[2]Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.
\[3]And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\[4]Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into yours hand.
\[5]So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and stroke them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\[6]And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
\[7]And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
\[8]And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
\[9]And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.
\[10]Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
\[11]Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I plead to you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.
\[12]Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver you up.
\[13]Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went anywhere they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he ceased to go forth.
\[14]And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
\[15]And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
\[16]And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
\[17]And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto you; and that also Saul my father knows.
\[18]And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
\[19]Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?
\[20]Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.
\[21]And Saul said, Blessed be all of you of the LORD; for all of you have compassion on me.
\[22]Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there: for it is told me that he deals very subtlely.
\[23]See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come all of you again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
\[24]And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
\[25]Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
\[26]And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
\[27]But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
\[28]Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.
\[29]And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.

nd it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.
\[2]Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
\[3]And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
\[4]And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto you, Behold, I will deliver yours enemy into yours hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good unto you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately.
\[5]And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart stroke him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
\[6]And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.
\[7]So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
\[8]David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
\[9]And David said to Saul, Wherefore hear you men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?
\[10]Behold, this day yours eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered you to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you: but mine eye spared you; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.
\[11]Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against you; yet you hunt my soul to take it.
\[12]The LORD judge between me and you, and the LORD avenge me of you: but mine hand shall not be upon you.
\[13]As says the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon you.
\[14]After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
\[15]The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of yours hand.
\[16]And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
\[17]And he said to David, You are more righteous than I: for you have rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded you evil.
\[18]And you have showed this day how that you have dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into yours hand, you killed me not.
\[19]For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward you good for that you have done unto me this day.
\[20]And now, behold, I know well that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in yours hand.
\[21]Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.
\[22]And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got them up unto the hold.

nd Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\[2]And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
\[3]Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was rude and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
\[4]And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
\[5]And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
\[6]And thus shall all of you say to him that lives in prosperity, Peace be both to you, and peace be to yours house, and peace be unto all that you have.
\[7]And now I have heard that you have shearers: now your shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\[8]Ask your young men, and they will show you. Wherefore let the young men find favour in yours eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray you, whatsoever comes to yours hand unto your servants, and to your son David.
\[9]And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
\[10]And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants these days that break away every man from his master.
\[11]Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?
\[12]So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.
\[13]And David said unto his men, Gird all of you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.
\[14]But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.
\[15]But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
\[16]They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
\[17]Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
\[18]Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
\[19]And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
\[20]And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
\[21]Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he has requited me evil for good.
\[22]So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisses against the wall.
\[23]And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
\[24]And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let yours handmaid, I pray you, speak in yours audience, and hear the words of yours handmaid.
\[25]Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I yours handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send.
\[26]Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, seeing the LORD has withheld you from coming to shed blood, and from avenging yourself with yours own hand, now let yours enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
\[27]And now this blessing which yours handmaid has brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
\[28]I pray you, forgive the trespass of yours handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in you all your days.
\[29]Yet a man has risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of yours enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.
\[30]And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you ruler over Israel;
\[31]That this shall be no grief unto you, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that you have shed blood causeless, or that my lord has avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember yours handmaid.
\[32]And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent you this day to meet me:
\[33]And blessed be your advice, and blessed be you, which have kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
\[34]For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, which has kept me back from hurting you, except you had hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisses against the wall.
\[35]So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to yours house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and have accepted your person.
\[36]And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\[37]But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
\[38]And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD stroke Nabal, that he died.
\[39]And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
\[40]And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying, David sent us unto you, to take you to him to wife.
\[41]And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let yours handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
\[42]And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
\[43]David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
\[44]But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

nd the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
\[2]Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\[3]And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
\[4]David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
\[5]And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
\[6]Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.
\[7]So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
\[8]Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered yours enemy into yours hand this day: now therefore let me strike him, I pray you, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not strike him the second time.
\[9]And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?
\[10]David said furthermore, As the LORD lives, the LORD shall strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
\[11]The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray you, take you now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
\[12]So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.
\[13]Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill far off; a great space being between them:
\[14]And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?
\[15]And David said to Abner, Are not you a valiant man? and who is like to you in Israel? wherefore then have you not kept your lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king your lord.
\[16]This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, all of you are worthy to die, because all of you have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
\[17]And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
\[18]And he said, Wherefore does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?
\[19]Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\[20]Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.
\[21]Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do you harm, because my soul was precious in yours eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
\[22]And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
\[23]The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.
\[24]And, behold, as your life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
\[25]Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David: you shall both do great things, and also shall still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

\[2]And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
\[3]And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.
\[4]And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
\[5]And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in yours eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?
\[6]Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertains unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
\[7]And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
\[8]And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
\[9]And David stroke the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
\[10]And Achish said, Where have all of you made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
\[11]And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should inform against us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwells in the country of the Philistines.

\[3]Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\[4]And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
\[5]And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
\[6]And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\[7]Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that has a familiar spirit at Endor.
\[8]And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray you, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto you.
\[9]And the woman said unto him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\[10]And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.
\[11]Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
\[12]And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.
\[13]And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
\[14]And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
\[15]And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known unto me what I shall do.
\[16]Then said Samuel, Wherefore then do you ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from you, and is become yours enemy?
\[17]And the LORD has done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD has rent the kingdom out of yours hand, and given it to your neighbour, even to David:
\[18]Because you obeyed not the voice of the LORD, nor executed his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore has the LORD done this thing unto you this day.
\[19]Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines: and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
\[20]Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
\[21]And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, yours handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto your words which you spoke unto me.
\[22]Now therefore, I pray you, hearken you also unto the voice of yours handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.
\[23]But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
\[24]And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
\[25]And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?
\[4]And the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?
\[5]Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
\[6]Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour you not.
\[7]Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that you displease not the lords of the Philistines.
\[8]And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
\[9]And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
\[10]Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with your master's servants that are come with you: and as soon as all of you be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.

\[5]And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\[6]And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
\[7]And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
\[8]And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for you shall surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
\[9]So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
\[10]But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
\[11]And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
\[12]And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
\[13]And David said unto him, To whom belong you? and whence are you? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
\[14]We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongs to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
\[15]And David said to him, Can you bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this company.
\[16]And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
\[17]And David stroke them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
\[18]And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
\[19]And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
\[20]And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
\[21]And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
\[22]Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.
\[23]Then said David, All of you shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD has given us, who has preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
\[24]For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike.
\[25]And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
\[26]And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
\[27]To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,
\[28]And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,
\[29]And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,
\[30]And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,
\[31]And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were known to haunt.

ow the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
\[2]And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.
\[3]And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
\[4]Then said Saul unto his armour bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armour bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
\[5]And when his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
\[6]So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armour bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
\[7]And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
\[8]And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
\[9]And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
\[10]And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.
\[11]And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
\[12]All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
\[13]And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

ow it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
\[2]It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did reverence.
\[3]And David said unto him, From whence come you? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
\[4]And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
\[5]And David said unto the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
\[6]And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
\[7]And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
\[8]And he said unto me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
\[9]He said unto me again, Stand, I pray you, upon me, and slay me: for anguish has come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
\[10]So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here unto my lord.
\[11]Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
\[12]And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
\[13]And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
\[14]And David said unto him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth yours hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?
\[15]And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he stroke him that he died.
\[16]And David said unto him, Your blood be upon your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.
\[17]And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
\[18](Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
\[19]The beauty of Israel is slain upon your high places: how are the mighty fallen!
\[20]Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
\[21]All of you mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
\[22]From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
\[23]Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
\[24]All of you daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
\[25]How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in yours high places.
\[26]I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been unto me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
\[27]How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

nd it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
\[2]So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
\[3]And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
\[4]And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.
\[5]And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be all of you of the LORD, that all of you have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
\[6]And now the LORD show kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because all of you have done this thing.
\[7]Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be all of you valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
\[8]But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
\[9]And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
\[10]Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
\[11]And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
\[12]And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\[13]And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
\[14]And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
\[15]Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
\[16]And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
\[17]And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
\[18]And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
\[19]And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
\[20]Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asahel? And he answered, I am.
\[21]And Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.
\[22]And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: wherefore should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?
\[23]Nevertheless he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear stroke him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
\[24]Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\[25]And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.
\[26]Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? know you not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brethren?
\[27]And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
\[28]So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
\[29]And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
\[30]And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
\[31]But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.
\[32]And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

ow there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
\[2]And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
\[3]And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
\[4]And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
\[5]And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
\[6]And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
\[7]And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore have you gone in unto my father's concubine?
\[8]Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul your father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?
\[9]So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD has sworn to David, even so I do to him;
\[10]To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
\[11]And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
\[12]And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel unto you.
\[13]And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.
\[14]And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
\[15]And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
\[16]And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
\[17]And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, All of you sought for David in times past to be king over you:
\[18]Now then do it: for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
\[19]And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
\[20]So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
\[21]And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with you, and that you may reign over all that yours heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
\[22]And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
\[23]When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
\[24]Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came unto you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?
\[25]You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.
\[26]And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
\[27]And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and stroke him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\[28]And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
\[29]Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread.
\[30]So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
\[31]And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.
\[32]And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
\[33]And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?
\[34]Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so fell you. And all the people wept again over him.
\[35]And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.
\[36]And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
\[37]For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
\[38]And the king said unto his servants, Know all of you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
\[39]And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

\[2]And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.
\[3]And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)
\[4]And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
\[5]And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
\[6]And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they stroke him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\[7]For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they stroke him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night.
\[8]And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul yours enemy, which sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
\[9]And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\[10]When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:
\[11]How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
\[12]And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron.

hen came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\[2]Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.
\[3]So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.
\[4]David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
\[5]In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
\[6]And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke unto David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.
\[7]Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.
\[8]And David said on that day, Whosoever gets up to the watercourse, and strikes the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
\[9]So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
\[10]And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.
\[11]And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and stone workers: and they built David an house.
\[12]And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
\[13]And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
\[14]And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
\[15]Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\[16]And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
\[17]But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
\[18]The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[19]And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? will you deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into yours hand.
\[20]And David came to Baalperazim, and David stroke them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.
\[21]And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
\[22]And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[23]And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them opposite to the mulberry trees.
\[24]And let it be, when you hear the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself: for then shall the LORD go out before you, to strike the host of the Philistines.
\[25]And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and stroke the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer.

\[2]And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwells between the cherubims.
\[3]And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
\[4]And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
\[5]And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
\[6]And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
\[7]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God stroke him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
\[8]And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.
\[9]And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
\[10]So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
\[11]And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.
\[12]And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertains unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.
\[13]And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
\[14]And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
\[15]So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
\[16]And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
\[17]And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
\[18]And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
\[19]And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.
\[20]Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
\[21]And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before your father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.
\[22]And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which you have spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.
\[23]Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.

nd it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;
\[2]That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
\[3]And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in yours heart; for the LORD is with you.
\[4]And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,
\[5]Go and tell my servant David, Thus says the LORD, Shall you build me an house for me to dwell in?
\[6]Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\[7]In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build all of you not me an house of cedar?
\[8]Now therefore so shall you say unto my servant David, Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
\[9]And I was with you anywhere you went, and have cut off all yours enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
\[10]Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as in time past,
\[11]And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all yours enemies. Also the LORD tells you that he will make you an house.
\[12]And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
\[13]He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
\[14]I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
\[15]But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
\[16]And yours house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.
\[17]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
\[18]Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that you have brought me until now?
\[19]And this was yet a small thing in your sight, O Lord GOD; but you have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
\[20]And what can David say more unto you? for you, Lord GOD, know your servant.
\[21]For your word's sake, and according to yours own heart, have you done all these great things, to make your servant know them.
\[22]Wherefore you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[23]And what one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for your land, before your people, which you redeemed to you from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
\[24]For you have confirmed to yourself your people Israel to be a people unto you for ever: and you, LORD, are become their God.
\[25]And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as you have said.
\[26]And let your name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of your servant David be established before you.
\[27]For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you an house: therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto you.
\[28]And now, O Lord GOD, you are that God, and your words be true, and you have promised this goodness unto your servant:
\[29]Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.

\[2]And he stroke Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
\[3]David stroke also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
\[4]And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David cut the hamstrings of all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.
\[5]And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\[6]Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David anywhere he went.
\[7]And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\[8]And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
\[9]When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
\[10]Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
\[11]Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;
\[12]Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
\[13]And David got him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.
\[14]And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David anywhere he went.
\[15]And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.
\[16]And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
\[17]And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

\[2]And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Are you Ziba? And he said, Your servant is he.
\[3]And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan has yet a son, which is lame on his feet.
\[4]And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.
\[5]Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.
\[6]Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!
\[7]And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.
\[8]And he bowed himself, and said, What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I am?
\[9]Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto your master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
\[10]You therefore, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him, and you shall bring in the fruits, that your master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth your master's son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
\[11]Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
\[12]And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.

\[2]Then said David, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\[3]And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Think you that David does honour your father, that he has sent comforters unto you? has not David rather sent his servants unto you, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
\[4]Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\[5]When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\[6]And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.
\[7]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
\[8]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
\[9]When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
\[10]And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
\[11]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
\[12]Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seems him good.
\[13]And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
\[14]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\[15]And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
\[16]And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
\[17]And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
\[18]And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and stroke Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
\[19]And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

nd it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
\[2]And it came to pass in an evening-time, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
\[3]And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
\[4]And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.
\[5]And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
\[6]And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
\[7]And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
\[8]And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a portion of food from the king.
\[9]But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
\[10]And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Came you not from your journey? why then did you not go down unto yours house?
\[11]And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
\[12]And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.
\[13]And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
\[14]And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
\[15]And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set all of you Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire all of you from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.
\[17]And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
\[18]Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
\[19]And charged the messenger, saying, When you have made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,
\[20]And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto you, Wherefore approached all of you so nigh unto the city when all of you did fight? knew all of you not that they would shoot from the wall?
\[21]Who stroke Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went all of you nigh the wall? then say you, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[22]So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
\[23]And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.
\[24]And the shooters shot from off the wall upon your servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\[25]Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shall you say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another: make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.
\[26]And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
\[27]And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

nd the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
\[2]The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:
\[3]But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own food, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
\[4]And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the travelling man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
\[5]And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:
\[6]And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
\[7]And Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus says the LORD God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;
\[8]And I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto you such and such things.
\[9]Wherefore have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\[10]Now therefore the sword shall never depart from yours house; because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
\[11]Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of yours own house, and I will take your wives before yours eyes, and give them unto your neighbour, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
\[12]For you did it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
\[13]And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
\[14]Nevertheless, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto you shall surely die.
\[15]And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
\[16]David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
\[17]And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
\[18]And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
\[19]But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
\[20]Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
\[21]Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.
\[22]And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
\[23]But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
\[24]And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
\[25]And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
\[26]And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\[27]And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
\[28]Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and camp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
\[29]And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
\[30]And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
\[31]And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

\[2]And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.
\[3]But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
\[4]And he said unto him, Why are you, being the king's son, lean from day to day? will you not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
\[5]And Jonadab said unto him, Lay you down on your bed, and make yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, say unto him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
\[6]So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray you, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
\[7]Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.
\[8]So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
\[9]And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
\[10]And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of yours hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\[11]And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.
\[12]And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly.
\[13]And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from you.
\[14]Nevertheless he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
\[15]Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
\[16]And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
\[17]Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
\[18]And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
\[19]And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
\[20]And Absalom her brother said unto her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
\[21]But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
\[22]And Absalom spoke unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
\[23]And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
\[24]And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I plead to you, and his servants go with your servant.
\[25]And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto you. And he pressed him: nevertheless he would not go, but blessed him.
\[26]Then said Absalom, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with you?
\[27]But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
\[28]Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark all of you now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Strike Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
\[29]And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled.
\[30]And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
\[31]Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
\[32]And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
\[33]Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
\[34]But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
\[35]And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as your servant said, so it is.
\[36]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
\[37]But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
\[38]So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
\[39]And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

ow Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.
\[2]And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray you, feign yourself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
\[3]And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
\[4]And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did reverence, and said, Help, O king.
\[5]And the king said unto her, What disturbs you? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
\[6]And your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one stroke the other, and slew him.
\[7]And, behold, the whole family has risen against yours handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that stroke his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.
\[8]And the king said unto the woman, Go to yours house, and I will give charge concerning you.
\[9]And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.
\[10]And the king said, Whoever says ought unto you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more.
\[11]Then said she, I pray you, let the king remember the LORD your God, that you would not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth.
\[12]Then the woman said, Let yours handmaid, I pray you, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
\[13]And the woman said, Wherefore then have you thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king does speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished.
\[14]For we must essentially die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
\[15]Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
\[16]For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
\[17]Then yours handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD your God will be with you.
\[18]Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you, the thing that I shall ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
\[19]And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king has spoken: for your servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of yours handmaid:
\[20]To fetch about this form of speech has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
\[21]And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
\[22]And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day your servant knows that I have found grace in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant.
\[23]So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\[24]And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
\[25]But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
\[26]And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
\[27]And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
\[28]So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
\[29]Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
\[30]Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
\[31]Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have your servants set my field on fire?
\[32]And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
\[33]So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

nd it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
\[2]And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
\[3]And Absalom said unto him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.
\[4]Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
\[5]And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him reverence, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
\[6]And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\[7]And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.
\[8]For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
\[9]And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
\[10]But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as all of you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all of you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.
\[11]And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
\[12]And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
\[13]And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
\[14]And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
\[15]And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.
\[16]And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.
\[17]And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
\[18]And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
\[19]Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile.
\[20]Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brethren: mercy and truth be with you.
\[21]And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your servant be.
\[22]And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
\[23]And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
\[24]And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
\[25]And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
\[26]But if he thus say, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good unto him.
\[27]The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
\[28]See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
\[29]Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
\[30]And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
\[31]And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
\[32]And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:
\[33]Unto whom David said, If you pass on with me, then you shall be a burden unto me:
\[34]But if you return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant until now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
\[35]And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that whatsoever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\[36]Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them all of you shall send unto me every thing that all of you can hear.
\[37]So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

nd when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\[2]And the king said unto Ziba, What mean you by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
\[3]And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
\[4]Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, yours are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly plead to you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.
\[5]And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
\[6]And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
\[7]And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:
\[8]The LORD has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose position you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man.
\[9]Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head.
\[10]And the king said, What have I to do with you, all of you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore have you done so?
\[11]And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came out of my bowels, seeks my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.
\[12]It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.
\[13]And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side opposite to him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
\[14]And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
\[15]And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
\[17]And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not with your friend?
\[18]And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
\[19]And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence.
\[20]Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
\[21]And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto your father's concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred of your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong.
\[22]So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
\[23]And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

oreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
\[2]And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only:
\[3]And I will bring back all the people unto you: the man whom you seek is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
\[4]And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
\[5]Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.
\[6]And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke unto him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak you.
\[7]And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.
\[8]For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\[9]Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
\[10]And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.
\[11]Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in yours own person.
\[12]So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
\[13]Moreover, if he be got into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
\[14]And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
\[15]Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
\[16]Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
\[17]Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a maid servant went and told them; and they went and told king David.
\[18]Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down.
\[19]And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.
\[20]And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you.
\[22]Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.
\[23]And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.
\[24]Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\[25]And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.
\[26]So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
\[27]And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\[28]Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched vegetables,
\[29]And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cattle, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

nd David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.
\[2]And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
\[3]But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you help us out of the city.
\[4]And the king said unto them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
\[5]And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
\[6]So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
\[7]Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
\[8]For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\[9]And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
\[10]And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
\[11]And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
\[12]And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
\[13]Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.
\[14]Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
\[15]And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and stroke Absalom, and slew him.
\[16]And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
\[17]And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
\[18]Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.
\[19]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies.
\[20]And Joab said unto him, You shall not bear tidings this day, but you shall bear tidings another day: but this day you shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
\[21]Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
\[22]Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray you, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore will you run, my son, seeing that you have no tidings ready?
\[23]But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi.
\[24]And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
\[25]And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came swiftly, and drew near.
\[26]And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the gate keeper, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings.
\[27]And the watchman said, It seems to me that the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.
\[28]And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD your God, which has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
\[29]And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
\[30]And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
\[31]And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you.
\[32]And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is.
\[33]And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!

nd it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
\[2]And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.
\[3]And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
\[4]But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
\[5]And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, which this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;
\[6]In that you love yours enemies, and hate your friends. For you have declared this day, that you regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.
\[7]Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto your servants: for I swear by the LORD, if you go not forth, there will not tarry one with you this night: and that will be worse unto you than all the evil that befell you from your youth until now.
\[8]Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
\[9]And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
\[10]And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak all of you not a word of bringing the king back?
\[11]And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are all of you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house.
\[12]All of you are my brethren, all of you are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are all of you the last to bring back the king?
\[13]And say all of you to Amasa, Are you not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
\[14]And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return you, and all your servants.
\[15]So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
\[16]And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
\[17]And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
\[18]And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;
\[19]And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
\[20]For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
\[21]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?
\[22]And David said, What have I to do with you, all of you sons of Zeruiah, that all of you should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
\[23]Therefore the king said unto Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore unto him.
\[24]And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
\[25]And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore went not you with me, Mephibosheth?
\[26]And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because your servant is lame.
\[27]And he has slandered your servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in yours eyes.
\[28]For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet did you set your servant among them that did eat at yours own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
\[29]And the king said unto him, Why speak you any more of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba divide the land.
\[30]And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king has come again in peace unto his own house.
\[31]And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
\[32]Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
\[33]And the king said unto Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will feed you with me in Jerusalem.
\[34]And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
\[35]I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should your servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
\[36]Your servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
\[37]Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto you.
\[38]And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto you: and whatsoever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.
\[39]And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
\[40]Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
\[41]And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
\[42]And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be all of you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or has he given us any gift?
\[43]And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than all of you: why then did all of you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

nd there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
\[2]So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
\[3]And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\[4]Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be you here present.
\[5]So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
\[6]And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take you your lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.
\[7]And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[8]When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
\[9]And Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
\[10]But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he stroke him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[11]And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favours Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
\[12]And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
\[13]When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
\[14]And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
\[15]And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
\[16]Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with you.
\[17]And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Are you Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of yours handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
\[18]Then she spoke, saying, They were known to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
\[19]I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?
\[20]And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\[21]The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
\[22]Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
\[23]Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
\[24]And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
\[25]And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
\[26]And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

hen there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
\[2]And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
\[3]Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that all of you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
\[4]And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shall you kill any man in Israel. And he said, What all of you shall say, that will I do for you.
\[5]And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
\[6]Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.
\[7]But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
\[8]But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
\[9]And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
\[10]And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
\[11]And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
\[12]And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
\[13]And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
\[14]And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was implored for the land.
\[15]Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
\[16]And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
\[17]But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and stroke the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the light of Israel.
\[18]And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.
\[19]And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\[20]And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
\[21]And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
\[22]These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

nd David spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
\[2]And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
\[3]The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; you save me from violence.
\[4]I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\[5]When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;
\[6]The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
\[7]In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.
\[8]Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was angry.
\[9]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\[10]He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
\[11]And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
\[12]And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
\[13]Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
\[14]The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
\[15]And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and humiliated them.
\[16]And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
\[17]He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
\[18]He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\[19]They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
\[20]He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\[21]The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
\[22]For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\[23]For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
\[24]I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.
\[25]Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
\[26]With the merciful you will show yourself merciful, and with the upright man you will show yourself upright.
\[27]With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the perverse you will show yourself unpleasing.
\[28]And the afflicted people you will save: but yours eyes are upon the haughty, that you may bring them down.
\[29]For you are my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
\[30]For by you I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
\[31]As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
\[32]For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
\[33]God is my strength and power: and he makes my way perfect.
\[34]He makes my feet like hinds' feet: and sets me upon my high places.
\[35]He teaches my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
\[36]You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your gentleness has made me great.
\[37]You have enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
\[38]I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
\[39]And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
\[40]For you have girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me have you subdued under me.
\[41]You have also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
\[42]They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
\[43]Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.
\[44]You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you have kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
\[45]Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
\[46]Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.
\[47]The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
\[48]It is God that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me.
\[49]And that brings me forth from mine enemies: you also have lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man.
\[50]Therefore I will give thanks unto you, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto your name.
\[51]He is the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

ow these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
\[2]The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue.
\[3]The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
\[4]And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
\[5]Although my house be not so with God; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.
\[6]But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
\[7]But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.
\[8]These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at the same.
\[9]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:
\[10]He arose, and stroke the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.
\[11]And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.
\[12]But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.
\[13]And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
\[14]And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
\[15]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
\[16]And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
\[17]And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
\[18]And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
\[19]Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: nevertheless he attained not unto the first three.
\[20]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
\[21]And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[22]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.
\[23]He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
\[24]Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\[25]Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
\[26]Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
\[27]Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
\[28]Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
\[29]Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
\[30]Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
\[31]Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
\[32]Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

nd again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
\[2]For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number all of you the people, that I may know the number of the people.
\[3]And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD your God add unto the people, no matter how many they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?
\[4]Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
\[5]And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
\[6]Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,
\[7]And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.
\[8]So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\[9]And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
\[10]And David's heart stroke him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I plead to you, O LORD, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[11]For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[12]Go and say unto David, Thus says the LORD, I offer you three things; choose you one of them, that I may do it unto you.
\[13]So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto you in your land? or will you flee three months before yours enemies, while they pursue you? or that there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
\[14]And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[15]So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
\[16]And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now yours hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[17]And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel that stroke the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let yours hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my father's house.
\[18]And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\[19]And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
\[20]And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
\[21]And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[22]And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
\[23]All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD your God accept you.
\[24]And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\[25]And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was implored for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

ow king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.
\[2]Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
\[3]So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
\[4]And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king had sexual contact with her not.
\[5]Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
\[6]And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.
\[7]And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
\[8]But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
\[9]And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
\[10]But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
\[11]Wherefore Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?
\[12]Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save yours own life, and the life of your son Solomon.
\[13]Go and get you in unto king David, and say unto him, Did not you, my lord, O king, swear unto yours handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?
\[14]Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.
\[15]And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
\[16]And Bathsheba bowed, and did reverence unto the king. And the king said, What would you?
\[17]And she said unto him, My lord, you sware by the LORD your God unto yours handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
\[18]And now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, you know it not:
\[19]And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon your servant has he not called.
\[20]And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
\[21]Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
\[22]And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
\[23]And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
\[24]And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
\[25]For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
\[26]But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, has he not called.
\[27]Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed it unto your servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
\[28]Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
\[29]And the king swore, and said, As the LORD lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,
\[30]Even as I swore unto you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my position; even so will I certainly do this day.
\[31]Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
\[32]And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
\[33]The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
\[34]And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow all of you with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
\[35]Then all of you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my position: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
\[36]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
\[37]As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
\[38]So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
\[39]And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
\[40]And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
\[41]And Adonijah and all the guest that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
\[42]And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for you are a valiant man, and bring good tidings.
\[43]And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king.
\[44]And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
\[45]And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that all of you have heard.
\[46]And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.
\[47]And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
\[48]And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which has given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
\[49]And all the guest that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
\[50]And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[51]And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon: for, lo, he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
\[52]And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
\[53]So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to yours house.

ow the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
\[2]I go the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a man;
\[3]And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and anywhere you turn yourself:
\[4]That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
\[5]Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
\[6]Do therefore according to your wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
\[7]But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.
\[8]And, behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.
\[9]Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you are a wise man, and know what you ought to do unto him; but his hoar head bring you down to the grave with blood.
\[10]So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
\[11]And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
\[12]Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
\[13]And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Come you peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
\[14]He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto you. And she said, Say on.
\[15]And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: nevertheless the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
\[16]And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
\[17]And he said, Speak, I pray you, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say you nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
\[18]And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you unto the king.
\[19]Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
\[20]Then she said, I desire one small petition of you; I pray you, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say you nay.
\[21]And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother to wife.
\[22]And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
\[23]Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
\[24]Now therefore, as the LORD lives, which has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
\[25]And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
\[26]And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, unto yours own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bare the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
\[27]So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\[28]Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\[29]And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
\[30]And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
\[31]And the king said unto him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
\[32]And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to know, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
\[33]Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.
\[34]So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
\[35]And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
\[36]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build you an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any where.
\[37]For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be upon yours own head.
\[38]And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
\[39]And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.
\[40]And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
\[41]And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
\[42]And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make you to swear by the LORD, and protested unto you, saying, Know for a certain, on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, that you shall surely die? and you said unto me, The word that I have heard is good.
\[43]Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged you with?
\[44]The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which yours heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness upon yours own head;
\[45]And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
\[46]So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.

nd Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
\[2]Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
\[3]And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
\[4]And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
\[5]In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give you.
\[6]And Solomon said, You have showed unto your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
\[7]And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
\[8]And your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\[9]Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?
\[10]And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.
\[11]And God said unto him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life; neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of yours enemies; but have asked for yourself understanding to discern judgment;
\[12]Behold, I have done according to your words: lo, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like unto you.
\[13]And I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto you all your days.
\[14]And if you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David did walk, then I will lengthen your days.
\[15]And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
\[16]Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
\[17]And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
\[18]And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
\[19]And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
\[20]And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while yours handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
\[21]And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
\[22]And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son. And this said, No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
\[23]Then said the king, The one says, This is my son that lives, and your son is the dead: and the other says, Nay; but your son is the dead, and my son is the living.
\[24]And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
\[25]And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
\[26]Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor yours, but divide it.
\[27]Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
\[28]And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.

\[2]And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
\[3]Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
\[4]And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
\[5]And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:
\[6]And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
\[7]And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
\[8]And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
\[9]The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:
\[10]The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
\[11]The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
\[12]Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:
\[13]The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars:
\[14]Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:
\[15]Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
\[16]Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:
\[17]Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
\[18]Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
\[19]Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.
\[20]Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
\[21]And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
\[22]And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
\[23]Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl.
\[24]For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
\[25]And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
\[26]And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
\[27]And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
\[28]Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
\[29]And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
\[30]And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
\[31]For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
\[32]And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
\[33]And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springs out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
\[34]And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

nd Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
\[2]And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
\[3]You know how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
\[4]But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.
\[5]And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto David my father, saying, Your son, whom I will set upon your throne in your room, he shall build an house unto my name.
\[6]Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and unto you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
\[7]And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which has given unto David a wise son over this great people.
\[8]And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me for: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
\[9]My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in rafts unto the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
\[10]So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
\[11]And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
\[12]And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
\[13]And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
\[14]And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
\[15]And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
\[16]Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
\[17]And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
\[18]And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the Gibalites also: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

nd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
\[2]And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
\[3]And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
\[4]And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
\[5]And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
\[6]The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
\[7]And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
\[8]The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.
\[9]So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
\[10]And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
\[11]And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
\[12]Concerning this house which you are in building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with you, which I spoke unto David your father:
\[13]And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
\[14]So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
\[15]And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
\[16]And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
\[17]And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
\[18]And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
\[19]And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\[20]And the oracle in the front part was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.
\[21]So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
\[22]And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
\[23]And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.
\[24]And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
\[25]And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.
\[26]The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
\[27]And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
\[28]And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
\[29]And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
\[30]And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
\[31]And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
\[32]The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
\[33]So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.
\[34]And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
\[35]And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
\[36]And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
\[37]In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
\[38]And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

ut Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
\[2]He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
\[3]And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.
\[4]And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.
\[5]And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
\[6]And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.
\[7]Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
\[8]And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
\[9]All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
\[10]And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
\[11]And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
\[12]And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
\[13]And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
\[14]He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
\[15]For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
\[16]And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits:
\[17]And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
\[18]And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital.
\[19]And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
\[20]And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, opposite to the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital.
\[21]And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
\[22]And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
\[23]And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
\[24]And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
\[25]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\[26]And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
\[27]And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
\[28]And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
\[29]And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
\[30]And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supporters: under the vessel that holds water were supporters molten, at the side of every addition.
\[31]And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
\[32]And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
\[33]And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their rims, and their spokes, were all molten.
\[34]And there were four supporters to the four corners of one base: and the supporters were of the very base itself.
\[35]And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.
\[36]For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
\[37]After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
\[38]Then made he ten lavers of brass: one vessel that holds water contained forty baths: and every vessel that holds water was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one vessel that holds water.
\[39]And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward opposite to the south.
\[40]And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
\[41]The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars;
\[42]And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;
\[43]And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
\[44]And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
\[45]And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.
\[46]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
\[47]And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
\[48]And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the showbread was,
\[49]And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
\[50]And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to know, of the temple.
\[51]So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

hen Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\[2]And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
\[3]And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
\[4]And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
\[5]And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\[6]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.
\[7]For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
\[8]And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.
\[9]There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
\[11]So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
\[12]Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
\[13]I have surely built you an house to dwell in, a settled place for you to abide in for ever.
\[14]And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
\[15]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
\[16]Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
\[17]And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[18]And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in yours heart to build an house unto my name, you did well that it was in yours heart.
\[19]Nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son that shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
\[20]And the LORD has performed his word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[21]And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
\[22]And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
\[23]And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keep covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with all their heart:
\[24]Who have kept with your servant David my father that you promised him: you spoke also with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with yours hand, as it is this day.
\[25]Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that you promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that your children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as you have walked before me.
\[26]And now, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be verified, which you spoke unto your servant David my father.
\[27]But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?
\[28]Yet have you respect unto the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which your servant prays before you to day:
\[29]That yours eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there: that you may hearken unto the prayer which your servant shall make toward this place.
\[30]And hearken you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear you in heaven your dwelling place: and when you hear, forgive.
\[31]If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before yours altar in this house:
\[32]Then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
\[33]When your people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall return to you, and confess your name, and pray, and make supplication unto you in this house:
\[34]Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which you gave unto their fathers.
\[35]When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:
\[36]Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, that you teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
\[37]If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
\[38]What prayer and supplication whatsoever be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
\[39]Then hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)
\[40]That they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave unto our fathers.
\[41]Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your name's sake;
\[42](For they shall hear of your great name, and of your strong hand, and of your stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
\[43]Hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for: that all people of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have built, is called by your name.
\[44]If your people go out to battle against their enemy, anywhere you shall send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name:
\[45]Then hear you in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[46]If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
\[47]Yet if they shall call to reflect themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
\[48]And so return unto you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto you toward their land, which you gave unto their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:
\[49]Then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
\[50]And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
\[51]For they be your people, and yours inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
\[52]That yours eyes may be open unto the supplication of your servant, and unto the supplication of your people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto you.
\[53]For you did separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be yours inheritance, as you spoke by the hand of Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.
\[54]And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
\[55]And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\[56]Blessed be the LORD, that has given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
\[57]The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
\[58]That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
\[59]And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
\[60]That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.
\[61]Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
\[62]And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
\[63]And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
\[64]The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and food offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and food offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
\[65]And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
\[66]On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.

nd it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,
\[2]That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
\[3]And the LORD said unto him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have hallowed this house, which you have built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
\[4]And if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my judgments:
\[5]Then I will establish the throne of your kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man upon the throne of Israel.
\[6]But if all of you shall at all turn from following me, all of you or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
\[7]Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
\[8]And at this house, which is high, every one that passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?
\[9]And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore has the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
\[10]And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
\[11](Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\[12]And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
\[13]And he said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
\[14]And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
\[15]And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; in order to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
\[16]For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
\[17]And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,
\[18]And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
\[19]And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
\[20]And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,
\[21]Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservants unto this day.
\[22]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
\[23]These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
\[24]But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
\[25]And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.
\[26]And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
\[27]And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
\[28]And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

nd when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
\[2]And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
\[3]And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
\[4]And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
\[5]And the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
\[6]And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of your acts and of your wisdom.
\[7]Nevertheless I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: your wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard.
\[8]Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, which stand continually before you, and that hear your wisdom.
\[9]Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he you king, to do judgment and justice.
\[10]And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
\[11]And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
\[12]And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.
\[13]And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
\[14]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
\[15]Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the trade of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
\[16]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.
\[17]And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[18]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
\[19]The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
\[20]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[21]And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\[22]For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[23]So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
\[24]And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
\[25]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[26]And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[27]And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
\[28]And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\[29]And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

ut king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:
\[2]Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, All of you shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
\[3]And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
\[4]For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
\[5]For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
\[6]And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.
\[7]Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
\[8]And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
\[9]And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,
\[10]And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
\[11]Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely rend the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.
\[12]Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it for David your father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of your son.
\[13]Nevertheless I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
\[14]And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
\[15]For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
\[16](For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
\[17]That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
\[18]And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
\[19]And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
\[20]And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
\[21]And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
\[22]Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what have you lacked with me, that, behold, you seek to go to yours own country? And he answered, Nothing: nevertheless let me go in any way.
\[23]And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
\[24]And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
\[25]And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
\[26]And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.
\[27]And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
\[28]And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
\[29]And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:
\[30]And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
\[31]And he said to Jeroboam, Take you ten pieces: for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you:
\[32](But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
\[33]Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
\[34]Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
\[35]But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto you, even ten tribes.
\[36]And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
\[37]And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.
\[38]And it shall be, if you will hearken unto all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto you.
\[39]And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
\[40]Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
\[41]And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
\[42]And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
\[43]And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his position.

nd Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
\[3]That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke unto Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve you.
\[5]And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do all of you advise that I may answer this people?
\[7]And they spoke unto him, saying, If you will be a servant unto this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:
\[9]And he said unto them, What counsel give all of you that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which your father did put upon us lighter?
\[10]And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shall you speak unto this people that spoke unto you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter unto us; thus shall you say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]And now whereas my father did load you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\[13]And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
\[14]And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[15]Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to yours own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
\[17]But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\[19]So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
\[20]And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
\[21]And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
\[22]But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[23]Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\[24]Thus says the LORD, All of you shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
\[25]Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
\[26]And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
\[27]If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people return unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
\[28]Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\[29]And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
\[30]And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.
\[31]And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the low of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
\[32]And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.
\[33]So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

nd, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
\[2]And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus says the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon you shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon you, and men's bones shall be burnt upon you.
\[3]And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD has spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
\[4]And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
\[5]The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
\[6]And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Implore now the face of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
\[7]And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
\[8]And the man of God said unto the king, If you will give me half yours house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
\[9]For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way that you came.
\[10]So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.
\[11]Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.
\[12]And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
\[13]And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
\[14]And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Are you the man of God that came from Judah? And he said, I am.
\[15]Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\[16]And he said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:
\[17]For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor return to go by the way that you came.
\[18]He said unto him, I am a prophet also as you are; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with you into yours house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.
\[19]So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
\[20]And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:
\[21]And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus says the LORD, Forasmuch as you have disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and have not kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,
\[22]But came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water; your carcass shall not come unto the tomb of your fathers.
\[23]And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to know, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
\[24]And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.
\[25]And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
\[26]And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD has delivered him unto the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke unto him.
\[27]And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.
\[28]And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.
\[29]And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
\[30]And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
\[31]And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
\[32]For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
\[33]After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the low of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
\[34]And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

t that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
\[2]And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray you, and disguise yourself, that you be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get you to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.
\[3]And take with you ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell you what shall become of the child.
\[4]And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
\[5]And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam comes to ask a thing of you for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shall you say unto her: for it shall be, when she comes in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.
\[6]And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you with heavy tidings.
\[7]Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel,
\[8]And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you: and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;
\[9]But have done evil above all that were before you: for you have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:
\[10]Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisses against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man takes away dung, till it be all gone.
\[11]Him that dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD has spoken it.
\[12]Arise you therefore, get you to yours own house: and when your feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
\[13]And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
\[14]Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
\[15]For the LORD shall strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
\[16]And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
\[17]And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
\[18]And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\[20]And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his position.
\[21]And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
\[22]And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
\[23]For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
\[24]And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[25]And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
\[26]And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[27]And king Rehoboam made in their position brazen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.
\[28]And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

\[3]And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
\[4]Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
\[5]Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
\[6]And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.

\[12]And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
\[13]And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
\[14]But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
\[15]And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\[16]And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\[17]And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
\[18]Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\[19]There is a league between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent unto you a present of silver and gold; come and break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[20]So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and stroke Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
\[21]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
\[22]Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had built; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\[23]The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.

\[25]And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
\[26]And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
\[27]And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha stroke him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
\[28]Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his position.
\[29]And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he stroke all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
\[30]Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.

\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[6]So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his position.
\[7]And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
\[8]In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
\[9]And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
\[10]And Zimri went in and stroke him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his position.
\[11]And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisses against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
\[12]Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.
\[13]For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
\[14]Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[15]In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
\[16]And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
\[17]And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
\[18]And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.
\[19]For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
\[20]Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[21]Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
\[22]But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\[23]In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
\[24]And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
\[25]But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.
\[26]For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
\[27]Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[28]So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his position.
\[29]And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
\[30]And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.
\[31]And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
\[32]And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
\[33]And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
\[34]In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.

nd Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
\[2]And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
\[3]Get you behind, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
\[4]And it shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.
\[5]So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
\[6]And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
\[7]And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
\[8]And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
\[9]Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you.
\[10]So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
\[11]And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of bread in yours hand.
\[12]And she said, As the LORD your God lives, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
\[13]And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for you and for your son.
\[14]For thus says the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth.
\[15]And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
\[16]And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
\[18]And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
\[19]And he said unto her, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into an upper room, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
\[20]And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, have you also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
\[21]And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray you, let this child's soul come into him again.
\[22]And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
\[23]And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, your son lives.
\[24]And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth.

nd it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
\[2]And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.
\[3]And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
\[4]For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
\[5]And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: possibly we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
\[6]So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
\[7]And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Are you that my lord Elijah?
\[8]And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\[9]And he said, What have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
\[10]As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not.
\[11]And now you says, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry you where I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth.
\[13]Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
\[14]And now you says, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.
\[15]And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to day.
\[16]So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
\[17]And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Are you he that troubles Israel?
\[18]And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that all of you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and you have followed Baalim.
\[19]Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
\[20]So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
\[21]And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt all of you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
\[22]Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
\[23]Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
\[24]And call all of you on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
\[25]And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for all of you are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
\[26]And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
\[27]And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or possibly he sleeps, and must be awaked.
\[28]And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
\[29]And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
\[30]And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.
\[31]And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be your name:
\[32]And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
\[33]And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
\[34]And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
\[35]And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
\[36]And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.
\[37]Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that you are the LORD God, and that you have turned their heart back again.
\[38]Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
\[39]And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.
\[40]And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
\[41]And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
\[42]So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
\[43]And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
\[44]And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there arises a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and get you down that the rain stop you not.
\[45]And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
\[46]And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

nd Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and likewise how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
\[2]Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.
\[3]And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
\[4]But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
\[5]And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
\[6]And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
\[7]And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for you.
\[8]And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
\[9]And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What do you here, Elijah?
\[10]And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down yours altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[11]And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:
\[12]And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
\[13]And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What do you here, Elijah?
\[14]And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down yours altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\[15]And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:
\[16]And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
\[18]Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.
\[19]So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
\[20]And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to you?
\[21]And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

nd Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
\[2]And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus says Benhadad,
\[3]Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.
\[4]And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to your saying, I am yours, and all that I have.
\[5]And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;
\[6]Yet I will send my servants unto you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search yours house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in yours eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
\[7]Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeks mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
\[8]And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.
\[9]Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you did send in order to your servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
\[10]And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
\[11]And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girds on his harness boast himself as he that puts it off.
\[12]And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.
\[13]And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus says the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into yours hand this day; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[14]And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, You.
\[15]Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
\[16]And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
\[17]And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
\[18]And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
\[19]So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
\[20]And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
\[21]And the king of Israel went out, and stroke the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\[22]And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.
\[23]And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
\[24]And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
\[25]And number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
\[26]And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
\[27]And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
\[28]And there came a man of God, and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus says the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into yours hand, and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[29]And they pitched one opposite to the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\[30]But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
\[31]And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray you, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: possibly he will save your life.
\[32]So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Benhadad says, I pray you, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
\[33]Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Your brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go all of you, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
\[34]And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
\[35]And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Strike me, I pray you. And the man refused to strike him.
\[36]Then said he unto him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall slay you. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
\[37]Then he found another man, and said, Strike me, I pray you. And the man stroke him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
\[38]So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
\[39]And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.
\[40]And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall your judgment be; yourself have decided it.
\[41]And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
\[42]And he said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Because you have let go out of your hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.
\[43]And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.

nd it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
\[2]And Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.
\[3]And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto you.
\[4]And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
\[5]But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?
\[6]And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.
\[7]And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let yours heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[8]So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
\[9]And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
\[10]And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
\[11]And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
\[12]They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\[13]And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
\[14]Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\[15]And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
\[16]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
\[17]And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[18]Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.
\[19]And you shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.
\[20]And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[21]Behold, I will bring evil upon you, and will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
\[22]And will make yours house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith you have provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
\[23]And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
\[24]Him that dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
\[25]But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
\[26]And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[27]And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\[28]And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\[29]See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

nd they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
\[2]And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
\[3]And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know all of you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
\[4]And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
\[5]And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD to day.
\[6]Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[7]And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
\[8]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[9]Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten here Micaiah the son of Imlah.
\[10]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\[11]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus says the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.
\[12]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.
\[13]And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
\[14]And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, what the LORD says unto me, that will I speak.
\[15]So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[16]And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure you that you tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?
\[17]And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
\[18]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
\[19]And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
\[20]And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
\[21]And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
\[22]And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You shall persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
\[23]Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil concerning you.
\[24]But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and stroke Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto you?
\[25]And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
\[26]And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\[27]And say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
\[28]And Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
\[29]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
\[30]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put you on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
\[31]But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
\[32]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
\[33]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
\[34]And a certain man drew a bow at random, and stroke the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn yours hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
\[35]And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
\[36]And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
\[37]So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
\[38]And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spoke.
\[39]Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[40]So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his position.
\[41]And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
\[42]Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[43]And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
\[44]And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
\[45]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[46]And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
\[47]There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
\[48]Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.
\[49]Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\[50]And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his position.
\[51]Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
\[52]And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
\[53]For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

hen Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\[2]And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.
\[3]But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that all of you go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
\[4]Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed.
\[5]And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are all of you now turned back?
\[6]And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, return unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus says the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you send to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.
\[7]And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?
\[8]And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
\[9]Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke unto him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.
\[10]And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[11]Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.
\[12]And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
\[13]And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.
\[14]Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your sight.
\[15]And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.
\[16]And he said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Forasmuch as you have sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.
\[17]So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his position in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

nd it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\[2]And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.
\[3]And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold all of you your peace.
\[4]And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.
\[5]And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold all of you your peace.
\[6]And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they two went on.
\[7]And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view far off: and they two stood by Jordan.
\[8]And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and stroke the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
\[9]And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.
\[10]And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so unto you; but if not, it shall not be so.
\[11]And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
\[12]And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
\[13]He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
\[14]And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and stroke the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted here and thither: and Elisha went over.
\[15]And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
\[16]And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest possibly the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, All of you shall not send.
\[17]And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
\[18]And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
\[19]And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is nil, and the ground barren.
\[20]And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
\[21]And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.
\[22]So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.
\[23]And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.
\[24]And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
\[25]And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

ow Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\[2]And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
\[3]Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not from it.
\[4]And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
\[5]But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\[6]And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
\[7]And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.
\[8]And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
\[9]So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
\[10]And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
\[11]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\[12]And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
\[13]And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\[14]And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.
\[15]But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
\[16]And he said, Thus says the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.
\[17]For thus says the LORD, All of you shall not see wind, neither shall all of you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that all of you may drink, both all of you, and your cattle, and your beasts.
\[18]And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
\[19]And all of you shall strike every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.
\[20]And it came to pass in the morning, when the food offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\[21]And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.
\[22]And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:
\[23]And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
\[24]And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and stroke the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
\[25]And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; nevertheless the slingers went about it, and stroke it.
\[26]And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.
\[27]Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his position, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.

ow there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.
\[2]And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for you? tell me, what have you in the house? And she said, Yours handmaid has not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
\[3]Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
\[4]And when you are come in, you shall shut the door upon you and upon your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.
\[5]So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
\[6]And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
\[7]Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children of the rest.
\[8]And it fell upon a certain day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
\[9]And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.
\[10]Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in thither.
\[11]And it fell upon a certain day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
\[12]And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
\[13]And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken in order to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
\[14]And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she has no child, and her husband is old.
\[15]And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
\[16]And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, you shall embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, you man of God, do not lie unto yours handmaid.
\[17]And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
\[18]And when the child was grown, it fell upon a certain day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
\[19]And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
\[20]And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
\[21]And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
\[22]And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
\[23]And he said, Wherefore will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
\[24]Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you.
\[25]So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her far off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:
\[26]Run now, I pray you, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well:
\[27]And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD has hid it from me, and has not told me.
\[28]Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
\[29]Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in yours hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
\[30]And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.
\[31]And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
\[32]And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
\[33]He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them two, and prayed unto the LORD.
\[34]And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
\[35]Then he returned, and walked in the house back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
\[36]And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up your son.
\[37]Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
\[38]And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
\[39]And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
\[40]So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O you man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.
\[41]But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
\[42]And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.
\[43]And his personal attendant said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus says the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.
\[44]So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.

ow Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.
\[2]And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
\[3]And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
\[4]And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
\[5]And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
\[6]And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter has come unto you, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover him of his leprosy.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.
\[8]And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore have you rent your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
\[9]So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
\[10]And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.
\[11]But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
\[12]Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
\[13]And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?
\[14]Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
\[15]And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.
\[16]But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
\[17]And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray you, be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth? for your servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.
\[18]In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.
\[19]And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
\[20]But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
\[21]So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
\[22]And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
\[23]And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
\[24]And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
\[25]But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence come you, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went no where.
\[26]And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and male servants, and maidservants?
\[27]The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto you, and unto your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.

nd the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with you is too strait for us.
\[2]Let us go, we pray you, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go all of you.
\[3]And one said, Be content, I pray you, and go with your servants. And he answered, I will go.
\[4]So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
\[5]But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
\[6]And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.
\[7]Therefore said he, Take it up to you. And he put out his hand, and took it.
\[8]Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
\[9]And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
\[10]And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
\[11]Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will all of you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?
\[12]And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.
\[13]And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
\[14]Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
\[15]And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
\[16]And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.
\[17]And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
\[18]And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Strike this people, I pray you, with blindness. And he stroke them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\[19]And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom all of you seek. But he led them to Samaria.
\[20]And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
\[21]And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I strike them? shall I strike them?
\[22]And he answered, You shall not strike them: would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
\[23]And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
\[24]And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
\[25]And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
\[26]And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
\[27]And he said, If the LORD do not help you, whence shall I help you? out of the barn floor, or out of the winepress?
\[28]And the king said unto her, What disturbs you? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give your son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son tomorrow.
\[29]So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him: and she has hid her son.
\[30]And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
\[31]Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
\[32]But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See all of you how this son of a murderer has sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
\[33]And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

hen Elisha said, Hear all of you the word of the LORD; Thus says the LORD, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\[2]Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with yours eyes, but shall not eat thereof.
\[3]And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
\[4]If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
\[5]And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.
\[6]For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
\[7]Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
\[8]And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
\[9]Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
\[10]So they came and called unto the gate keeper of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.
\[11]And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.
\[12]And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
\[13]And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray you, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
\[14]They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
\[15]And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
\[16]And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
\[17]And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
\[18]And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
\[19]And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with yours eyes, but shall not eat thereof.
\[20]And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.

hen spoke Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and yours household, and sojourn where ever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
\[2]And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\[3]And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
\[4]And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things that Elisha has done.
\[5]And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
\[6]And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
\[7]And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God has come here.
\[8]And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in yours hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\[9]So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
\[10]And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, You may certainly recover: nevertheless the LORD has showed me that he shall surely die.
\[11]And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
\[12]And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
\[13]And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.
\[14]So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to you? And he answered, He told me that you should surely recover.
\[15]And it came to pass on the next day, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his position.
\[16]And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
\[17]Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[18]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[19]Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.
\[20]In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
\[21]So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and stroke the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
\[22]Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
\[23]And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[24]And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his position.
\[25]In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
\[26]Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
\[27]And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.
\[28]And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\[29]And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

nd Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up your loins, and take this box of oil in yours hand, and go to Ramothgilead:
\[2]And when you come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
\[3]Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus says the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
\[4]So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
\[5]And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to you, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To you, O captain.
\[6]And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.
\[7]And you shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
\[8]For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
\[9]And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
\[10]And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
\[11]Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to you? And he said unto them, All of you know the man, and his communication.
\[12]And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus says the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel.
\[13]Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
\[14]So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
\[15]But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.
\[16]So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
\[17]And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
\[18]So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he comes not again.
\[19]Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me.
\[20]And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and comes not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.
\[21]And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\[22]And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
\[23]And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
\[24]And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and stroke Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
\[25]Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;
\[26]Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, says the LORD; and I will requite you in this portion, says the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the portion of ground, according to the word of the LORD.
\[27]But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Strike him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\[28]And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.
\[29]And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
\[30]And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.
\[31]And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
\[32]And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
\[33]And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.
\[34]And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.
\[35]And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
\[36]Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
\[37]And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

nd Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,
\[2]Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;
\[3]Look even out the best and fittest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
\[4]But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
\[5]And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you shall bid us; we will not make any king: do you that which is good in yours eyes.
\[6]Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If all of you be mine, and if all of you will hearken unto my voice, take all of you the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.
\[7]And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.
\[8]And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay all of you them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
\[9]And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, All of you be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
\[10]Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.
\[11]So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
\[12]And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,
\[13]Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are all of you? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
\[14]And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
\[15]And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is yours heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me yours hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
\[16]And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.
\[17]And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.
\[18]And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.
\[19]Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be lacking: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be lacking, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\[20]And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
\[21]And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
\[22]And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
\[23]And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.
\[24]And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
\[25]And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they stroke them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
\[26]And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
\[27]And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.
\[28]Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
\[29]Nevertheless from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to know, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
\[30]And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and have done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, your children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
\[31]But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.
\[32]In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael stroke them in all the coasts of Israel;
\[33]From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[35]And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his position.
\[36]And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.

\[2]But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
\[3]And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.
\[4]And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.
\[5]And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that all of you shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
\[6]And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall all of you keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
\[7]And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.
\[8]And all of you shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that comes within the ranges, let him be slain: and be all of you with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.
\[9]And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
\[10]And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.
\[11]And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.
\[12]And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
\[13]And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.
\[14]And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
\[15]But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that follows her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
\[16]And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
\[17]And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the people.
\[18]And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
\[19]And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
\[20]And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.

\[2]And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
\[3]But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\[4]And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passes the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that comes into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,
\[5]Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, where ever any breach shall be found.
\[6]But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
\[7]Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair all of you not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
\[8]And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
\[9]But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
\[10]And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
\[11]And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,
\[12]And to stone workers, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
\[13]Nevertheless there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:
\[14]But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.
\[15]Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
\[16]The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.
\[17]Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
\[18]And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.
\[19]And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[20]And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.

\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not from it.
\[3]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.
\[4]And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
\[5](And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as in time past.
\[6]Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
\[7]Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
\[8]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\[9]And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his position.

\[13]And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
\[14]Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
\[15]And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.
\[16]And he said to the king of Israel, Put yours hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
\[17]And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, till you have consumed them.
\[18]And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Strike upon the ground. And he stroke three times, and stayed.
\[19]And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have smitten five or six times; then had you smitten Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall strike Syria but three times.
\[20]And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
\[21]And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
\[22]But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
\[23]And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.
\[24]So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his position.
\[25]And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

\[3]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
\[4]Nevertheless the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
\[5]And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.
\[6]But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
\[7]He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
\[8]Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
\[9]And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
\[10]You have indeed smitten Edom, and yours heart has lifted you up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?
\[11]But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\[12]And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
\[13]And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

\[13]And he burnt his burnt offering and his food offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.
\[14]And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.
\[15]And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening food offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his food offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their food offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to enquire by.
\[16]Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
\[17]And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the vessel that holds water from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement of stones.
\[18]And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.

\[20]And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his position.

n the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
\[3]Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
\[4]And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
\[5]Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
\[6]In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\[7]For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
\[8]And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
\[9]And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
\[10]And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
\[11]And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:
\[12]For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, All of you shall not do this thing.
\[13]Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn all of you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
\[14]Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.
\[15]And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
\[16]And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
\[17]And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[18]Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
\[19]Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
\[20]And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
\[21]For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
\[22]For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
\[23]Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
\[24]And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
\[25]And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.
\[26]Wherefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
\[27]Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom all of you brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
\[28]Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
\[29]Nevertheless every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
\[30]And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
\[31]And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
\[32]So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the low of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
\[33]They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
\[34]Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
\[35]With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, All of you shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
\[36]But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall all of you fear, and him shall all of you worship, and to him shall all of you do sacrifice.
\[37]And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, all of you shall observe to do for evermore; and all of you shall not fear other gods.
\[38]And the covenant that I have made with you all of you shall not forget; neither shall all of you fear other gods.
\[39]But the LORD your God all of you shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\[40]Nevertheless they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
\[41]So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

ow it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
\[2]Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
\[3]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
\[4]He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
\[5]He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.
\[6]For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
\[7]And the LORD was with him; and he prospered anywhere he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
\[8]He stroke the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
\[10]And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
\[11]And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
\[12]Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.
\[13]Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
\[14]And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\[15]And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.
\[16]At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
\[17]And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the launderer's field.
\[18]And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
\[19]And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak all of you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?
\[20]You says, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?
\[21]Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
\[22]But if all of you say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, All of you shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
\[23]Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders upon them.
\[24]How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[25]Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[26]Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\[27]But Rabshakeh said unto them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
\[28]Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
\[29]Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
\[30]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[31]Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat all of you every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink all of you every one the waters of his cistern:
\[32]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that all of you may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
\[33]Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[34]Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
\[35]Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
\[36]But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\[37]Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said unto him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: wherefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that are left.
\[5]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall all of you say to your master, Thus says the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\[9]And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he has come out to fight against you: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall all of you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwell between the cherubims, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
\[16]LORD, bow down yours ear, and hear: open, LORD, yours eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.
\[17]Truthfully, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
\[18]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\[19]Now therefore, O LORD our God, I plead to you, save you us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD God, even you only.
\[20]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, That which you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
\[21]This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
\[22]Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up yours eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
\[23]By your messengers you have reproached the LORD, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.
\[24]I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
\[25]Have you not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.
\[26]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
\[27]But I know your abode, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.
\[28]Because your rage against me and your tumult has come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
\[29]And this shall be a sign unto you, All of you shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow all of you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.
\[30]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\[31]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
\[32]Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
\[33]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, says the LORD.
\[34]For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[35]And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and stroke in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
\[36]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\[37]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons stroke him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his position.

n those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Set yours house in order; for you shall die, and not live.
\[2]Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,
\[3]I plead to you, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
\[4]And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
\[5]Return, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you: on the third day you shall go up unto the house of the LORD.
\[6]And I will add unto your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[7]And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
\[8]And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?
\[9]And Isaiah said, This sign shall you have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
\[10]And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
\[11]And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.
\[12]At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\[13]And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
\[14]Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
\[15]And he said, What have they seen in yours house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
\[16]And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
\[17]Behold, the days come, that all that is in yours house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
\[18]And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall brought forth, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[19]Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?
\[20]And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
\[3]For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\[8]Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
\[9]But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
\[10]And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
\[11]Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols:
\[12]Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
\[13]And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.
\[14]And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
\[15]Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
\[16]Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[17]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[18]And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his position.
\[19]Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
\[20]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.
\[21]And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
\[22]And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.
\[23]And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
\[24]And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his position.

\[2]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
\[3]And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
\[4]Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:
\[5]And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,
\[6]Unto carpenters, and builders, and stone workers, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
\[7]Nevertheless there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
\[8]And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
\[9]And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.
\[10]And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\[12]And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\[13]Go all of you, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.
\[14]So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
\[15]And she said unto them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
\[16]Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read:
\[17]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
\[18]But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall all of you say to him, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, As concerning the words which you have heard;
\[19]Because yours heart was tender, and you have humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says the LORD.
\[20]Behold therefore, I will gather you unto your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace; and yours eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.

nd the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
\[2]And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.
\[3]And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
\[4]And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.
\[5]And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
\[6]And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.
\[7]And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
\[8]And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
\[9]Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
\[10]And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
\[11]And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
\[12]And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
\[13]And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
\[14]And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
\[15]Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.
\[16]And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
\[17]Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the tomb of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.
\[18]And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
\[19]And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.
\[20]And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
\[21]And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.
\[22]Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
\[23]But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.
\[24]Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
\[25]And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
\[26]Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him likewise.
\[27]And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\[28]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[29]In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
\[30]And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's position.
\[31]Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[32]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
\[33]And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
\[34]And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.
\[35]And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.
\[36]Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
\[37]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

n his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
\[2]And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
\[3]Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;
\[4]And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.
\[5]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
\[6]So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his position.
\[7]And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
\[8]Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
\[9]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
\[10]At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
\[11]And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.
\[12]And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
\[13]And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
\[14]And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\[15]And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\[16]And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and able for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
\[17]And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his position, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
\[18]Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[19]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[20]For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

nd it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.
\[2]And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[3]And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[4]And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.
\[5]And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
\[6]So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
\[7]And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
\[8]And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:
\[9]And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.
\[10]And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[11]Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.
\[12]But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
\[13]And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
\[14]And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
\[15]And the fire-pans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
\[16]The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[17]The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was brass: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the interwoven work, and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with interwoven work.
\[18]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\[19]And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:
\[20]And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
\[21]And the king of Babylon stroke them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
\[22]And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
\[23]And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\[24]And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
\[25]But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and stroke Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
\[26]And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
\[27]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
\[28]And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;
\[29]And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.
\[30]And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

\[2]For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

\[8]And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:
\[9]And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.
\[10]And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.
\[11]And the children of Gad dwelt opposite to them, in the land of Bashan unto Salcah:
\[12]Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.

\[19]And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.
\[20]And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was implored of them; because they put their trust in him.
\[21]And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.
\[22]For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.
\[23]And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon.
\[24]And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers.
\[25]And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.
\[26]And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.

\[2]Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.
\[3]And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;
\[4]Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.
\[5]And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.
\[6]And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and ninety.
\[7]And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,
\[8]And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;
\[9]And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers.
\[10]And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,
\[11]And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;
\[12]And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;
\[13]And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.
\[14]And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
\[15]And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;
\[16]And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.
\[17]And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;
\[18]Who until now waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.
\[19]And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.
\[20]And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him.
\[21]And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gate keeper of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\[22]All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.
\[23]So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.
\[24]In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
\[25]And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.
\[26]For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
\[27]And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them.
\[28]And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale.
\[29]Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
\[30]And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.
\[31]And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.
\[32]And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the showbread, to prepare it every sabbath.
\[33]And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.
\[34]These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
\[35]And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:
\[36]And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab.
\[37]And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.
\[38]And Mikloth brings forth Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, opposite to their brethren.
\[39]And Ner brings forth Kish; and Kish brings forth Saul; and Saul brings forth Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
\[40]And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal brings forth Micah.
\[41]And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz.
\[42]And Ahaz brings forth Jarah; and Jarah brings forth Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri brings forth Moza;
\[43]And Moza brings forth Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.

ow the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
\[2]And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
\[3]And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.
\[4]Then said Saul to his armour bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armour bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
\[5]And when his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
\[6]So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
\[7]And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
\[8]And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
\[9]And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.
\[10]And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
\[11]And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\[12]They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\[13]So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;
\[14]And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

hen all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\[2]And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD your God said unto you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be ruler over my people Israel.
\[3]Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
\[4]And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
\[5]And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come here. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.
\[6]And David said, Whosoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.
\[7]And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.
\[8]And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\[9]So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.
\[10]These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
\[11]And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at the same.
\[12]And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\[13]He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\[14]And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.
\[15]Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\[16]And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.
\[17]And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!
\[18]And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.
\[19]And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three might.
\[20]And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.
\[21]Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: nevertheless he attained not to the first three.
\[22]Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
\[23]And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
\[24]These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighty men.
\[25]Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.
\[26]Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\[27]Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
\[28]Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,
\[29]Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

\[2]They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.
\[3]The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.
\[4]And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,

\[7]And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
\[8]And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;
\[9]Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
\[10]Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
\[11]Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\[12]Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\[13]Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.
\[14]These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
\[15]These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
\[16]And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.
\[17]And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If all of you be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if all of you be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.
\[18]Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Yours are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to yours helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
\[19]And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.
\[20]As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.
\[21]And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.
\[22]For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.
\[23]And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
\[24]The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.
\[25]Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
\[26]Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
\[27]And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;
\[28]And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.
\[29]And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for until now the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
\[30]And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
\[31]And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
\[32]And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.
\[33]Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.
\[34]And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
\[35]And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
\[36]And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.
\[37]And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.
\[38]All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
\[39]And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
\[40]Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and food, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

nd David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.
\[2]And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:
\[3]And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
\[4]And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\[5]So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.
\[6]And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwells between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.
\[7]And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
\[8]And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\[9]And when they came unto the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
\[10]And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he stroke him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.
\[11]And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.
\[12]And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
\[13]So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.
\[14]And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.

\[9]And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\[10]And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will you deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into yours hand.
\[11]So they came up to Baalperazim; and David stroke them there. Then David said, God has broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking out of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.
\[12]And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
\[13]And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.

\[15]And it shall be, when you shall hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle: for God is gone forth before you to strike the host of the Philistines.

\[2]Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.
\[3]And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.
\[4]And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
\[5]Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:
\[6]Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
\[7]Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty:
\[8]Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:
\[9]Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:
\[10]Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.
\[11]And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
\[12]And said unto them, All of you are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both all of you and your brethren, that all of you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.
\[13]For because all of you did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
\[14]So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
\[15]And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.
\[16]And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
\[17]So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
\[18]And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.
\[19]So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;
\[20]And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
\[21]And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
\[22]And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.
\[23]And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
\[24]And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
\[25]So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.
\[26]And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
\[27]And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.
\[28]Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.
\[29]And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.

o they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
\[2]And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
\[3]And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
\[4]And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:
\[5]Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
\[6]Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
\[7]Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
\[8]Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.
\[9]Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk all of you of all his wondrous works.
\[10]Glory all of you in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
\[11]Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
\[12]Remember his marvellous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
\[13]O all of you seed of Israel his servant, all of you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\[14]He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
\[15]Be all of you mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;
\[16]Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;
\[17]And has confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\[18]Saying, Unto you will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
\[19]When all of you were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
\[20]And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;
\[21]He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
\[22]Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
\[23]Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation.
\[24]Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.
\[25]For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.
\[26]For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
\[27]Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.
\[28]Give unto the LORD, all of you families of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
\[29]Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
\[30]Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
\[31]Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigns.
\[32]Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
\[33]Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he comes to judge the earth.
\[34]O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.
\[35]And say all of you, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise.
\[36]Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.
\[37]So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:
\[38]And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:
\[39]And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,
\[40]To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;
\[41]And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endures for ever;
\[42]And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.
\[43]And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.

ow it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remains under curtains.
\[2]Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in yours heart; for God is with you.
\[3]And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\[4]Go and tell David my servant, Thus says the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:
\[5]For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
\[6]Where ever I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have all of you not built me an house of cedars?
\[7]Now therefore thus shall you say unto my servant David, Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that you should be ruler over my people Israel:
\[8]And I have been with you anywhere you have walked, and have cut off all yours enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
\[9]Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,
\[10]And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all yours enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the LORD will build you an house.
\[11]And it shall come to pass, when your days be expired that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, which shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
\[12]He shall build me an house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
\[13]I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before you:
\[14]But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.
\[15]According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
\[16]And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that you have brought me until now?
\[17]And yet this was a small thing in yours eyes, O God; for you have also spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
\[18]What can David speak more to you for the honour of your servant? for you know your servant.
\[19]O LORD, for your servant's sake, and according to yours own heart, have you done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
\[20]O LORD, there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\[21]And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?
\[22]For your people Israel did you make yours own people for ever; and you, LORD, became their God.
\[23]Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as you have said.
\[24]Let it even be established, that your name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David your servant be established before you.
\[25]For you, O my God, have told your servant that you will build him an house: therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray before you.
\[26]And now, LORD, you are God, and have promised this goodness unto your servant:
\[27]Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may be before you for ever: for you bless, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

\[2]And he stroke Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
\[3]And David stroke Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
\[4]And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also cut the hamstrings of all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.
\[5]And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
\[6]Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David anywhere he went.
\[7]And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\[8]Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
\[9]Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
\[10]He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
\[11]Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
\[12]Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
\[13]And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David anywhere he went.
\[14]So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
\[15]And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
\[16]And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

ow it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his position.
\[2]And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
\[3]But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you that David does honour your father, that he has sent comforters unto you? are not his servants come unto you in order to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
\[4]Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
\[5]Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\[6]And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves abhorrent to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
\[7]So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
\[8]And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
\[9]And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
\[10]Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
\[11]And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
\[12]And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will help you.
\[13]Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.
\[14]So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
\[15]And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
\[16]And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
\[17]And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\[18]But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
\[19]And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

\[2]And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.
\[3]And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.
\[5]And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.
\[6]And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.

nd Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
\[2]And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
\[3]And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
\[4]Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
\[6]But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
\[7]And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he stroke Israel.
\[8]And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I plead to you, do away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\[9]And the LORD spoke unto Gad, David's seer, saying,
\[10]Go and tell David, saying, Thus says the LORD, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it unto you.
\[11]So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Choose you
\[12]Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before your foes, while that the sword of yours enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise yourself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
\[13]And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\[14]So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
\[15]And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now yours hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[16]And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
\[17]And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let yours hand, I pray you, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on your people, that they should be plagued.
\[18]Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[19]And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.
\[20]And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\[21]And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
\[22]Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: you shall grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\[23]And Ornan said unto David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the food offering; I give it all.
\[24]And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
\[25]So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\[26]And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
\[27]And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
\[28]At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\[29]For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
\[30]But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

\[2]And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set stone workers to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
\[3]And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
\[4]Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
\[5]And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
\[6]Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.
\[7]And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:
\[8]But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house unto my name, because you have shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
\[9]Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
\[10]He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
\[11]Now, my son, the LORD be with you; and prosper you, and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has said of you.
\[12]Only the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
\[13]Then shall you prosper, if you take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
\[14]Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.
\[15]Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.
\[16]Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with you.
\[17]David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
\[18]Is not the LORD your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for he has given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
\[19]Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build all of you the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.

o when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
\[2]And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
\[3]Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
\[4]Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:
\[5]Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.
\[6]And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\[7]Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.
\[8]The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
\[9]The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
\[10]And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
\[11]And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.
\[12]The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\[13]The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.
\[14]Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
\[15]The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.
\[16]Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
\[17]And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
\[18]Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
\[19]Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\[20]Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.
\[21]The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
\[22]And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
\[23]The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
\[24]These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.
\[25]For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:
\[26]And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
\[27]For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:
\[28]Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
\[29]Both for the showbread, and for the fine flour for food offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
\[30]And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even:
\[31]And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:
\[32]And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.

\[3]And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.
\[4]And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.
\[5]Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

\[2]Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:
\[3]But God said unto me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.
\[4]Nevertheless the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:
\[5]And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
\[6]And he said unto me, Solomon your son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
\[7]Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
\[8]Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that all of you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.
\[9]And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.
\[10]Take heed now; for the LORD has chosen you to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
\[11]Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,
\[12]And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:
\[13]Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.
\[14]He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:
\[15]Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
\[16]And by weight he gave gold for the tables of showbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:
\[17]Also pure gold for the forks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver:
\[18]And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\[19]All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.
\[20]And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
\[21]And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with you for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with you for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at your commandment.

\[2]Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, flashing stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\[3]Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.
\[4]Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses likewise:
\[5]The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?
\[6]Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
\[7]And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
\[8]And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\[9]Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
\[10]Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be you, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
\[11]Yours, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.
\[12]Both riches and honour come of you, and you reign over all; and in yours hand is power and might; and in yours hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
\[13]Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.
\[14]But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of yours own have we given you.
\[15]For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.
\[16]O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you an house for yours holy name comes of yours hand, and is all yours own.
\[17]I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto you.
\[18]O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart unto you:
\[19]And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
\[20]And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.
\[21]And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the next day after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
\[22]And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.
\[23]Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
\[24]And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
\[25]And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
\[26]Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\[27]And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
\[28]And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his position.
\[29]Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
\[30]With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

\[2]Then Solomon spoke unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
\[3]So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
\[4]But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\[5]Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.
\[6]And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
\[7]In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give you.
\[8]And Solomon said unto God, You have showed great mercy unto David my father, and have made me to reign in his position.
\[9]Now, O LORD God, let your promise unto David my father be established: for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
\[10]Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this your people, that is so great?
\[11]And God said to Solomon, Because this was in yours heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of yours enemies, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:
\[12]Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before you, neither shall there any after you have the like.
\[13]Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
\[14]And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[15]And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as abundant as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
\[16]And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
\[17]And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

\[2]And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
\[3]And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you did deal with David my father, and did send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.
\[4]Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.
\[5]And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.
\[6]But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
\[7]Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
\[8]Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,
\[9]Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.
\[10]And, behold, I will give to your servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
\[11]Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD has loved his people, he has made you king over them.
\[12]Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, imbued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.
\[13]And now I have sent a cunning man, imbued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
\[14]The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with your cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David your father.
\[15]Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
\[16]And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.
\[17]And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
\[18]And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.

hen Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\[2]And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
\[3]Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\[4]And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
\[5]And the greater house he covered over with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
\[6]And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
\[7]He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.
\[8]And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
\[9]And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
\[10]And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
\[11]And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
\[12]And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
\[13]The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.
\[14]And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.
\[15]Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
\[16]And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
\[17]And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

oreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
\[2]Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
\[3]And under it was the embodiment of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.
\[4]It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\[5]And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.
\[6]He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
\[7]And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
\[8]He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.
\[9]Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
\[10]And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, opposite to the south.
\[11]And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
\[12]To know, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
\[13]And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were upon the pillars.
\[14]He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;
\[15]One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
\[16]The pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.
\[17]In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
\[18]Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
\[19]And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the showbread was set;
\[20]Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
\[21]And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;
\[22]And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.

hus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.
\[2]Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
\[3]Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.
\[4]And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
\[5]And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
\[6]Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
\[7]And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:
\[8]For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
\[9]And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
\[10]There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
\[11]And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:
\[12]Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
\[13]It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;
\[14]So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.

\[2]But I have built an house of habitation for you, and a place for your dwelling for ever.
\[3]And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
\[4]And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,
\[5]Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
\[6]But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
\[7]Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[8]But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in yours heart to build an house for my name, you did well in that it was in yours heart:
\[9]Notwithstanding you shall not build the house; but your son which shall come forth out of your loins, he shall build the house for my name.
\[10]The LORD therefore has performed his word that he has spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
\[11]And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.
\[12]And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:
\[13]For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.
\[14]And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keep covenant, and show mercy unto your servants, that walk before you with all their hearts:
\[15]You which have kept with your servant David my father that which you have promised him; and spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with yours hand, as it is this day.
\[16]Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that your children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as you have walked before me.
\[17]Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you have spoken unto your servant David.
\[18]But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!
\[19]Have respect therefore to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which your servant prays before you:
\[20]That yours eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof you have said that you would put your name there; to hearken unto the prayer which your servant prays toward this place.
\[21]Hearken therefore unto the supplications of your servant, and of your people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear you from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.
\[22]If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before yours altar in this house;
\[23]Then hear you from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
\[24]And if your people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; and shall return and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;
\[25]Then hear you from the heavens, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.
\[26]When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them;
\[27]Then hear you from heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you have taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon your land, which you have given unto your people for an inheritance.
\[28]If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:
\[29]Then what prayer or what supplication whatsoever shall be made of any man, or of all your people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
\[30]Then hear you from heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you only know the hearts of the children of men:)
\[31]That they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave unto our fathers.
\[32]Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of your people Israel, but has come from a far country for your great name's sake, and your mighty hand, and your stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;
\[33]Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for; that all people of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.
\[34]If your people go out to war against their enemies by the way that you shall send them, and they pray unto you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;
\[35]Then hear you from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\[36]If they sin against you, (for there is no man which sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;
\[37]Yet if they call to reflect themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
\[38]If they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which you gave unto their fathers, and toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:
\[39]Then hear you from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people which have sinned against you.
\[40]Now, my God, let, I plead to you, yours eyes be open, and let yours ears be attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place.
\[41]Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness.
\[42]O LORD God, turn not away the face of yours anointed: remember the mercies of David your servant.

ow when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
\[2]And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.
\[3]And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.
\[4]Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
\[5]And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\[6]And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endures for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
\[7]Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the food offerings, and the fat.
\[8]Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.
\[9]And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
\[10]And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
\[11]Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
\[12]And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.
\[13]If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
\[14]If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
\[15]Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place.
\[16]For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
\[17]And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and shall observe my statutes and my judgments;
\[18]Then will I establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.
\[19]But if all of you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
\[20]Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.
\[21]And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it; so that he shall say, Why has the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
\[22]And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore has he brought all this evil upon them.

\[2]That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
\[3]And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
\[4]And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
\[5]Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
\[6]And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
\[7]As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,
\[8]But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
\[9]But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
\[10]And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
\[11]And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, unto which the ark of the LORD has come.
\[12]Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,
\[13]Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
\[14]And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
\[15]And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
\[16]Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.
\[17]Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
\[18]And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

\[2]And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
\[3]And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
\[4]And the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
\[5]And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of yours acts, and of your wisdom:
\[6]Nevertheless I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: for you exceed the fame that I heard.
\[7]Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, which stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.
\[8]Blessed be the LORD your God, which delighted in you to set you on his throne, to be king for the LORD your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he you king over them, to do judgment and justice.
\[9]And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
\[10]And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
\[11]And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
\[12]And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
\[13]Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
\[14]Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
\[15]And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.
\[16]And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\[17]Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
\[18]And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:
\[19]And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
\[20]And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
\[21]For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\[22]And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\[23]And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
\[24]And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\[25]And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
\[26]And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
\[27]And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.
\[28]And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
\[29]Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
\[30]And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

\[2]And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, where he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
\[3]And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\[4]Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease you somewhat the grievous servitude of your father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve you.
\[5]And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
\[6]And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give all of you me to return answer to this people?
\[7]And they spoke unto him, saying, If you be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants for ever.
\[8]But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
\[9]And he said unto them, What advice give all of you that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that your father did put upon us?
\[10]And the young men that were brought up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shall you answer the people that spoke unto you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it somewhat lighter for us; thus shall you say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
\[11]For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[12]So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
\[13]And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
\[14]And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\[15]So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\[16]And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to yours own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
\[17]But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\[18]Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\[19]And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

nd when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
\[2]But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
\[3]Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
\[4]Thus says the LORD, All of you shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
\[5]And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
\[6]He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
\[7]And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
\[8]And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
\[9]And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
\[10]And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.
\[11]And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
\[12]And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
\[13]And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
\[14]For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:
\[15]And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
\[16]And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.
\[17]So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
\[18]And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
\[19]Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
\[20]And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
\[21]And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and brings forth twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
\[22]And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.
\[23]And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.

nd it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
\[2]And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
\[3]With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
\[4]And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
\[5]Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus says the LORD, All of you have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\[6]Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.
\[7]And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\[8]Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
\[9]So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
\[10]Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
\[11]And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
\[12]And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
\[13]So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
\[14]And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
\[15]Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
\[16]And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his position.

ow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
\[2]He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
\[3]And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.
\[4]And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, you Jeroboam, and all Israel;
\[5]Ought all of you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
\[6]Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, has risen up, and has rebelled against his lord.
\[7]And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
\[8]And now all of you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and all of you be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
\[9]Have all of you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.
\[10]But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:
\[11]And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but all of you have forsaken him.
\[12]And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight all of you not against the LORD God of your fathers; for all of you shall not prosper.
\[13]But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
\[14]And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\[15]Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God stroke Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
\[16]And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
\[17]And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
\[18]Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
\[19]And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.
\[20]Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
\[21]But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and brings forth twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

\[2]And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
\[3]For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
\[4]And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
\[5]Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
\[6]And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
\[7]Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
\[8]And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.
\[9]And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
\[10]Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
\[11]And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on you, and in your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let no man prevail against you.
\[12]So the LORD stroke the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
\[13]And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
\[14]And they stroke all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
\[15]They stroke also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

\[2]And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear all of you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while all of you be with him; and if all of you seek him, he will be found of you; but if all of you forsake him, he will forsake you.
\[3]Now for a long season Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
\[4]But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
\[5]And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
\[6]And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
\[7]Be all of you strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
\[8]And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.
\[9]And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
\[10]So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
\[11]And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
\[12]And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
\[13]That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
\[14]And they swore unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
\[15]And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.
\[16]And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
\[17]But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
\[18]And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

\[2]Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
\[3]There is a league between me and you, as there was between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
\[4]And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they stroke Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
\[5]And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
\[6]Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
\[7]And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of yours hand.
\[8]Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you did rely on the LORD, he delivered them into yours hand.
\[9]For the eyes of the LORD run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly: therefore from henceforth you shall have wars.
\[10]Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.
\[11]And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[12]And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

\[4]But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
\[5]Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.
\[6]And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
\[7]Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

\[3]And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; and we will be with you in the war.
\[4]And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD to day.
\[5]Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
\[6]But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
\[7]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
\[8]And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
\[9]And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
\[10]And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says the LORD, With these you shall push Syria until they be consumed.
\[11]And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
\[12]And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let your word therefore, I pray you, be like one of their's, and speak you good.
\[13]And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, even what my God says, that will I speak.
\[14]And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go all of you up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
\[15]And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you that you say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
\[16]Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.
\[17]And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
\[18]Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
\[19]And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
\[20]Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?
\[21]And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall entice him, and you shall also prevail: go out, and do even so.
\[22]Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil against you.
\[23]Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and stroke Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto you?
\[24]And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
\[25]Then the king of Israel said, Take all of you Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
\[26]And say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
\[27]And Micaiah said, If you certainly return in peace, then has not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all you people.
\[28]So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
\[29]And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put you on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
\[30]Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight all of you not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
\[31]And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.
\[32]For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
\[33]And a certain man drew a bow at random, and stroke the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn yours hand, that you may carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
\[34]And the battle increased that day: nevertheless the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

\[10]And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
\[11]Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.
\[12]O our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon you.
\[13]And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
\[14]Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;
\[15]And he said, Hearken all of you, all Judah, and all of you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat, Thus says the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.
\[16]Tomorrow go all of you down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and all of you shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
\[17]All of you shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand all of you still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.
\[18]And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.
\[19]And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
\[20]And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and all of you inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall all of you be established; believe his prophets, so shall all of you prosper.
\[21]And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endures for ever.
\[22]And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
\[23]For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
\[24]And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.
\[25]And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
\[26]And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.
\[27]Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
\[28]And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.
\[29]And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.
\[30]So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.
\[31]And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\[32]And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.
\[33]Nevertheless the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
\[34]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
\[35]And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:
\[36]And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.
\[37]Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has broken your works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

ow Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his position.
\[2]And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
\[3]And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.
\[4]Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.
\[5]Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\[6]And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
\[7]Nevertheless the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.
\[8]In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
\[9]Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and stroke the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.
\[10]So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
\[11]Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.
\[12]And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says the LORD God of David your father, Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
\[13]But have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also have slain your brethren of your father's house, which were better than yourself:
\[14]Behold, with a great plague will the LORD strike your people, and your children, and your wives, and all your goods:
\[15]And you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
\[16]Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:
\[17]And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was not a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
\[18]And after all this the LORD stroke him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
\[19]And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
\[20]Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Nevertheless they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.

nd the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his position: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
\[2]Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
\[3]He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
\[4]Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.
\[5]He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians stroke Joram.
\[6]And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
\[7]And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\[8]And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
\[9]And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
\[10]But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
\[11]But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
\[12]And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

nd in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
\[2]And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
\[3]And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD has said of the sons of David.
\[4]This is the thing that all of you shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
\[5]And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.
\[7]And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else comes into the house, he shall be put to death: but be all of you with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out.
\[8]So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
\[9]Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.
\[10]And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.
\[11]Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
\[12]Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:
\[13]And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
\[14]Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her out of the ranges: and whoso follows her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
\[15]So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
\[16]And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people.
\[17]Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
\[18]Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.
\[19]And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.
\[20]And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
\[21]And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

oash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.
\[2]And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
\[3]And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he brings forth sons and daughters.
\[4]And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.
\[5]And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that all of you hasten the matter. Nevertheless the Levites hastened it not.
\[6]And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why have you not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
\[7]For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.
\[8]And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
\[9]And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
\[10]And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
\[11]Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\[12]And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired stone workers and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
\[13]So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
\[14]And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer likewise, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
\[15]But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
\[16]And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
\[17]Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made reverence to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
\[18]And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
\[19]Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
\[20]And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus says God, Why transgress all of you the commandments of the LORD, that all of you cannot prosper? because all of you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.
\[21]And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.
\[22]Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.
\[23]And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
\[24]For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.
\[25]And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.
\[26]And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
\[27]Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his position.

maziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
\[2]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.
\[3]Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
\[4]But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
\[5]Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
\[6]He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
\[7]But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with you; for the LORD is not with Israel, to know, with all the children of Ephraim.
\[8]But if you will go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make you fall before the enemy: for God has power to help, and to cast down.
\[9]And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give you much more than this.
\[10]Then Amaziah separated them, to know, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
\[11]And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and stroke of the children of Seir ten thousand.
\[12]And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
\[13]But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and stroke three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
\[14]Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
\[15]Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of yours hand?
\[16]And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Are you made of the king's counsel? forbear; why should you be smitten? Then the prophet ceased, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not hearkened unto my counsel.
\[17]Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
\[18]And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
\[19]You says, Lo, you have smitten the Edomites; and yours heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you meddle to yours hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?
\[20]But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
\[21]So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\[22]And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
\[23]And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\[24]And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
\[25]And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
\[27]Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
\[28]And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

\[3]Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
\[4]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.
\[5]And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
\[6]And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\[7]And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.
\[8]And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.
\[9]Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
\[10]Also he built towers in the desert, and dug many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved farming.
\[11]Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
\[12]The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.
\[13]And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
\[14]And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
\[15]And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones likewise. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
\[16]But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
\[17]And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:
\[18]And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertains not unto you, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for yours honour from the LORD God.
\[19]Then Uzziah was angry, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
\[20]And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
\[21]And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
\[22]Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
\[23]So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his position.

\[8]He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
\[9]And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his position.

haz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:
\[2]For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
\[3]Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
\[4]He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\[5]Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they stroke him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who stroke him with a great slaughter.
\[6]For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
\[7]And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
\[8]And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
\[9]But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and all of you have slain them in a rage that reachs up unto heaven.
\[10]And now all of you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?
\[11]Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which all of you have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.
\[12]Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
\[13]And said unto them, All of you shall not bring in the captives here: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, all of you intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
\[14]So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
\[15]And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
\[16]At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
\[17]For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
\[18]The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
\[19]For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.
\[20]And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
\[21]For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
\[22]And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.
\[23]For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which stroke him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
\[24]And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
\[25]And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
\[26]Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[27]And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his position.

ezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
\[2]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
\[3]He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.
\[4]And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,
\[5]And said unto them, Hear me, all of you Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
\[6]For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.
\[7]Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
\[8]Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as all of you see with your eyes.
\[9]For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
\[10]Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
\[11]My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that all of you should minister unto him, and burn incense.
\[12]Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
\[13]And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
\[14]And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
\[15]And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
\[16]And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.
\[17]Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\[18]Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the showbread table, with all the vessels thereof.
\[19]Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.
\[20]Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
\[21]And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
\[22]So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
\[23]And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
\[24]And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
\[25]And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.
\[26]And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
\[27]And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.
\[28]And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
\[29]And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
\[30]Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
\[31]Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now all of you have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
\[32]And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
\[33]And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
\[34]But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
\[35]And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
\[36]And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

nd Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
\[2]For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
\[3]For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
\[4]And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
\[5]So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.
\[6]So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, All of you children of Israel, return unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
\[7]And be not all of you like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as all of you see.
\[8]Now be all of you not stubborn, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
\[9]For if all of you return unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if all of you return unto him.
\[10]So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
\[11]Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
\[12]Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
\[13]And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
\[14]And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
\[15]Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
\[16]And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.
\[17]For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.
\[18]For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one
\[19]That prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.
\[20]And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
\[21]And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.
\[22]And Hezekiah spoke comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
\[23]And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.
\[24]For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
\[25]And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
\[26]So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
\[27]Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.

ow when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
\[2]And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
\[3]He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to know, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.
\[4]Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.
\[5]And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first- fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
\[6]And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.
\[7]In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
\[8]And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.
\[9]Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
\[10]And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.
\[11]Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,
\[12]And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.
\[13]And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
\[14]And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gate keeper toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.
\[15]And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
\[16]Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that enters into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
\[17]Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;
\[18]And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
\[19]Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
\[20]And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.
\[21]And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

fter these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.
\[2]And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
\[3]He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.
\[4]So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
\[5]Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
\[6]And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,
\[7]Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:
\[8]With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
\[9]After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
\[10]Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do all of you trust, that all of you abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
\[11]Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[12]Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, All of you shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
\[13]Know all of you not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?
\[14]Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?
\[15]Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?
\[16]And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
\[17]He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.
\[18]Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
\[19]And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.
\[20]And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
\[21]And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came out of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
\[22]Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.
\[23]And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
\[24]In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spoke unto him, and he gave him a sign.
\[25]But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
\[26]Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
\[27]And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;
\[28]Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
\[29]Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.
\[30]This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
\[31]Nevertheless in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
\[32]Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\[33]And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his position.

anasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
\[2]But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
\[3]For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
\[4]Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
\[5]And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
\[6]And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
\[7]And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
\[8]Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
\[9]So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
\[10]And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.
\[11]Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
\[12]And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
\[13]And prayed unto him: and he was implored of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.
\[14]Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.
\[15]And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
\[16]And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
\[17]Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.
\[18]Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.
\[19]His prayer also, and how God was implored of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.
\[20]So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his position.
\[21]Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\[22]But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
\[23]And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
\[24]And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
\[25]But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his position.

osiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
\[2]And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.
\[3]For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
\[4]And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and scattered it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.
\[5]And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
\[6]And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
\[7]And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
\[8]Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
\[9]And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
\[10]And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:
\[11]Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
\[12]And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of music.
\[13]Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
\[14]And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.
\[15]And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
\[16]And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they do it.
\[17]And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
\[18]Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
\[19]And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
\[20]And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
\[21]Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.
\[22]And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.
\[23]And she answered them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Tell all of you the man that sent you to me,
\[24]Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:
\[25]Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
\[26]And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall all of you say unto him, Thus says the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which you have heard;
\[27]Because yours heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst yourself before me, and did rend your clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard you also, says the LORD.
\[28]Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall yours eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
\[29]Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[30]And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.
\[31]And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.
\[32]And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
\[33]And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

oreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
\[2]And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,
\[3]And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,
\[4]And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
\[5]And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.
\[6]So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\[7]And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.
\[8]And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen.
\[9]Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
\[10]So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
\[11]And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.
\[12]And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
\[13]And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings cook they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.
\[14]And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
\[15]And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
\[16]So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
\[17]And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
\[18]And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[19]In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
\[20]After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
\[21]But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear you from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy you not.
\[22]Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\[23]And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
\[24]His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
\[25]And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
\[26]Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,
\[27]And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

hen the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's position in Jerusalem.
\[2]Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
\[3]And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\[4]And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
\[5]Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
\[6]Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
\[7]Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
\[8]Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his position.
\[9]Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.
\[10]And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
\[11]Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
\[12]And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.
\[13]And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.
\[14]Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
\[15]And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up early, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
\[16]But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
\[17]Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.
\[18]And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.
\[19]And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
\[20]And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
\[21]To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years.
\[22]Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
\[23]Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has the LORD God of heaven given me; and he has charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.

ow in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
\[2]Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
\[3]Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.
\[4]And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.
\[5]Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.
\[6]And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.
\[7]Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;
\[8]Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
\[9]And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
\[10]Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
\[11]All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

nd when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
\[2]Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
\[3]And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
\[4]They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
\[5]And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.
\[6]From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
\[7]They gave money also unto the stone workers, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
\[8]Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
\[9]Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
\[10]And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
\[11]And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
\[12]But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
\[13]So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far off.

ow when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity built the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;
\[2]Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as all of you do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up here.
\[3]But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, All of you have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.
\[4]Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
\[5]And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
\[6]And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
\[7]And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
\[8]Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
\[9]Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,
\[10]And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.
\[11]This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Your servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.
\[12]Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from you to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.
\[13]Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so you shall spoil the revenue of the kings.
\[14]Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
\[15]That search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so shall you find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
\[16]We certify the king that, if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means you shall have no portion on this side the river.
\[17]Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
\[18]The letter which all of you sent unto us has been plainly read before me.
\[19]And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
\[20]There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
\[21]Give all of you now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another commandment shall be given from me.
\[22]Take heed now that all of you fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
\[23]Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
\[24]Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

\[2]Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.

\[7]They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.
\[8]Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goes fast on, and prospers in their hands.
\[9]Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?
\[10]We asked their names also, to certify you, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
\[11]And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.
\[12]But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
\[13]But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
\[14]And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
\[15]And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in his place.
\[16]Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not finished.
\[17]Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

\[2]And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:
\[3]In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
\[4]With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
\[5]And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.
\[6]Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be all of you far from thence:
\[7]Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.
\[8]Moreover I make a decree what all of you shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.
\[9]And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:
\[10]That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
\[11]Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
\[12]And the God that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
\[13]Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.
\[14]And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
\[15]And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
\[16]And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.
\[17]And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
\[18]And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
\[19]And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.
\[20]For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
\[21]And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,
\[22]And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

\[19]The vessels also that are given you for the service of the house of your God, those deliver you before the God of Jerusalem.
\[20]And whatsoever more shall be necessary for the house of your God, which you shall have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.
\[21]And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,
\[22]Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
\[23]Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
\[24]Also we certify you, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.
\[25]And you, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God, that is in yours hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach all of you them that know them not.
\[26]And whosoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
\[27]Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:
\[28]And has extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.

\[3]Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.
\[4]Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
\[5]Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
\[6]Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
\[7]And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
\[8]And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males.
\[9]Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
\[10]And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males.
\[11]And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males.
\[12]And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males.
\[13]And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.
\[14]Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
\[15]And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
\[16]Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
\[17]And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
\[18]And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
\[19]And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
\[20]Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.
\[21]Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
\[22]For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
\[23]So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was implored of us.
\[24]Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
\[25]And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:
\[26]I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;
\[27]Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
\[28]And I said unto them, All of you are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.
\[29]Watch all of you, and keep them, until all of you weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
\[30]So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
\[31]Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
\[32]And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
\[33]Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
\[34]By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
\[35]Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.
\[36]And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.

\[2]For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.
\[3]And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished.
\[4]Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.
\[5]And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,
\[6]And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.
\[7]Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
\[8]And now for a little space grace has been showed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
\[9]For we were bondmen; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
\[10]And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,
\[11]Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which all of you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
\[12]Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that all of you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
\[13]And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that you our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such deliverance as this;
\[14]Should we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? would not you be angry with us till you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
\[15]O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before you in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before you because of this.

ow when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.
\[2]And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
\[3]Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
\[4]Arise; for this matter belongs unto you: we also will be with you: be of good courage, and do it.
\[5]Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they swore.
\[6]Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
\[7]And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
\[8]And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
\[9]Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
\[10]And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, All of you have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.
\[11]Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.
\[12]Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you have said, so must we do.
\[13]But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
\[14]Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
\[15]Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
\[16]And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
\[17]And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.

\[7]We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which you commandedst your servant Moses.
\[8]Remember, I plead to you, the word that you commandedst your servant Moses, saying, If all of you transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
\[9]But if all of you turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
\[10]Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.
\[11]O LORD, I plead to you, let now yours ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

\[3]And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
\[4]Then the king said unto me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
\[5]And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if your servant have found favour in your sight, that you would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it.
\[6]And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
\[7]Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;
\[8]And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
\[9]Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
\[10]When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
\[11]So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\[12]And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
\[13]And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
\[14]Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
\[15]Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.
\[16]And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
\[17]Then said I unto them, All of you see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
\[18]Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.
\[19]But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that all of you do? will all of you rebel against the king?
\[20]Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but all of you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

ut it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
\[2]And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
\[3]Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.
\[4]Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
\[5]And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before you: for they have provoked you to anger before the builders.
\[6]So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
\[7]But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very angry,
\[8]And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
\[9]Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
\[10]And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
\[11]And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
\[12]And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence all of you shall return unto us they will be upon you.
\[13]Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\[14]And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not all of you afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
\[15]And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
\[16]And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
\[17]They which built on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.
\[18]For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
\[19]And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
\[20]In what place therefore all of you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort all of you thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.
\[21]So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
\[22]Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.
\[23]So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.

nd there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
\[2]For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.
\[3]Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
\[4]There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.
\[5]Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
\[6]And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
\[7]Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, All of you exact interest, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
\[8]And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will all of you even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.
\[9]Also I said, It is not good that all of you do: ought all of you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
\[10]I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this interest.
\[11]Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive yards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that all of you exact of them.
\[12]Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you says. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
\[13]Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performs not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
\[14]Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
\[15]But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
\[16]Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.
\[17]Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.
\[18]Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
\[19]Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.

ow it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
\[2]That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
\[3]And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
\[4]Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
\[5]Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
\[6]Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause you build the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words.
\[7]And you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
\[8]Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as you says, but you feign them out of yours own heart.
\[9]For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
\[10]Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yea, in the night will they come to slay you.
\[11]And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
\[12]And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\[13]Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
\[14]My God, think you upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
\[15]So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
\[16]And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
\[17]Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.
\[18]For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
\[19]Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

ow it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
\[2]That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.
\[3]And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be opposite to his house.
\[4]Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.
\[5]And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,
\[6]These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;
\[7]Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;

\[59]The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.
\[60]All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
\[61]And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not show their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.
\[62]The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
\[63]And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.
\[64]These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
\[65]And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
\[66]The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
\[67]Beside their male servants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.
\[68]Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five:
\[69]Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
\[70]And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
\[71]And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver.
\[72]And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments.

nd all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
\[2]And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
\[3]And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.
\[4]And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
\[5]And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
\[6]And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
\[7]Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.
\[8]So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.
\[9]And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
\[10]Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be all of you sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.
\[11]So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be all of you grieved.
\[12]And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great delight, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
\[13]And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
\[14]And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:

\[16]So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
\[17]And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
\[18]Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.

ow in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sack clothes, and earth upon them.
\[2]And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\[3]And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.
\[4]Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.
\[5]Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
\[6]You, even you, are LORD alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and you preserve them all; and the host of heaven worships you.
\[7]You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;
\[8]And found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous:
\[9]And did see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red sea;
\[10]And showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you knew that they dealt proudly against them. So did you get you a name, as it is this day.
\[11]And you did divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors you threw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
\[12]Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
\[13]You came down also upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
\[14]And made known unto them your holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses your servant:
\[15]And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.
\[16]But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to your commandments,
\[17]And refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsook them not.
\[18]Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
\[19]Yet you in your manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.
\[20]You gave also your good spirit to instruct them, and withheld not your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.
\[21]Yea, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
\[22]Moreover you gave them kingdoms and nations, and did divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
\[23]Their children also multiplied you as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land, concerning which you had promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
\[24]So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
\[25]And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells dug, vineyards, and olive yards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.
\[26]Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their backs, and slew your prophets which testified against them to turn them to you, and they wrought great provocations.
\[27]Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
\[28]But after they had rest, they did evil again before you: therefore left you them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies;
\[29]And testified against them, that you might bring them again unto your law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
\[30]Yet many years did you forbear them, and testified against them by your spirit in your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the people of the lands.
\[31]Nevertheless for your great mercies' sake you did not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.
\[32]Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keep covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before you, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
\[33]Nevertheless you are just in all that is brought upon us; for you have done right, but we have done wickedly:
\[34]Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor hearkened unto your commandments and your testimonies, wherewith you did testify against them.
\[35]For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
\[36]Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that you gave unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:
\[37]And it yields much increase unto the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
\[38]And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

\[23]The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
\[24]And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren opposite to them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward opposite to ward.
\[25]Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
\[26]These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
\[27]And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
\[28]And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
\[29]Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them villages round about Jerusalem.
\[30]And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\[31]Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
\[32]And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
\[33]And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
\[34]Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
\[35]And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
\[36]And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
\[37]And at the fountain gate, which was opposite to them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
\[38]And the other company of them that gave thanks went opposite to them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;
\[39]And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.
\[40]So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
\[41]And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
\[42]And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
\[43]Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even far off.
\[44]And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
\[45]And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
\[46]For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
\[47]And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.

n that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
\[2]Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: nevertheless our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\[3]Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\[4]And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:
\[5]And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where in old times they laid the food offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
\[6]But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
\[7]And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\[8]And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.
\[9]Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the food offering and the frankincense.
\[10]And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
\[11]Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
\[12]Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
\[13]And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.
\[14]Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
\[15]In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.
\[16]There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
\[17]Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that all of you do, and profane the sabbath day?
\[18]Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet all of you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
\[19]And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
\[20]So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
\[21]Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge all of you about the wall? if all of you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
\[22]And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy.
\[23]In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:
\[24]And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
\[25]And I contended with them, and cursed them, and stroke certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, All of you shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
\[26]Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.
\[27]Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
\[28]And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
\[29]Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
\[30]Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
\[31]And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

\[3]In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:

\[6]Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
\[7]And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
\[8]And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
\[9]Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
\[10]On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
\[11]To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
\[12]But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very angry, and his anger burned in him.
\[13]Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
\[14]And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
\[15]What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
\[16]And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
\[17]For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
\[18]Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.
\[19]If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
\[20]And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.
\[21]And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
\[22]For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.

fter these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
\[2]Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
\[3]And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:
\[4]And let the maiden which pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
\[5]Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
\[6]Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
\[7]And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
\[8]So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
\[9]And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.
\[10]Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it.
\[11]And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
\[12]Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to know, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)
\[13]Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.
\[14]In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
\[15]Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
\[16]So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
\[17]And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
\[18]Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
\[19]And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
\[20]Esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like when she was brought up with him.
\[21]In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
\[22]And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.
\[23]And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.

fter these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
\[2]And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
\[3]Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why trangress you the king's commandment?
\[4]Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
\[5]And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
\[6]And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had showed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
\[7]In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
\[8]And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
\[9]If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
\[10]And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
\[11]And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.
\[12]Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
\[13]And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
\[14]The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.
\[15]The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.

hen Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
\[2]And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
\[3]And in every province, anywhere the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
\[4]So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
\[5]Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
\[6]So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.
\[7]And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
\[8]Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
\[9]And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
\[10]Again Esther spoke unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
\[11]All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
\[12]And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
\[13]Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with yourself that you shall escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.
\[14]For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but you and your father's house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
\[15]Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
\[16]Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast all of you for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.

\[2]And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
\[3]Then said the king unto her, What will you, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be even given you to the half of the kingdom.
\[4]And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
\[5]Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
\[6]And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.

\[8]If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.

\[10]Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
\[11]And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.

\[3]And the king said, What honour and dignity has been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
\[4]And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.

\[8]Let the royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:
\[9]And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man likewise whom the king delights to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour.
\[10]Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sits at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.

\[6]For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?

\[8]Write all of you also for the Jews, as it likes you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.

\[10]And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

\[2]The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
\[3]And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
\[4]For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
\[5]Thus the Jews stroke all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.

\[13]Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
\[14]And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
\[15]For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
\[16]But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,
\[17]On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[18]But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
\[19]Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the towns without protective walls, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
\[20]And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,
\[21]To establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
\[22]As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
\[23]And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
\[24]Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
\[25]But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
\[26]Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,
\[27]The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;
\[28]And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
\[29]Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
\[30]And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
\[31]To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had commanded with authority them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

here was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
\[2]And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
\[3]His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
\[4]And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\[5]And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
\[6]Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
\[7]And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence come you? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
\[8]And the LORD said unto Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and turns away from evil?
\[9]Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?
\[10]Have not you made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
\[11]But put forth yours hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.
\[12]And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself put not forth yours hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
\[13]And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
\[14]And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
\[15]And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[16]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[17]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[18]While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
\[19]And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and stroke the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.
\[20]Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
\[21]And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
\[22]In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

\[2]And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence come you? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
\[3]And the LORD said unto Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and turns away from evil? and still he holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.
\[4]And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has will he give for his life.
\[5]But put forth yours hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.
\[6]And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in yours hand; but save his life.
\[7]So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and stroke Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
\[8]And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself likewise; and he sat down among the ashes.
\[9]Then said his wife unto him, Do you still retain yours integrity? curse God, and die.
\[10]But he said unto her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
\[11]Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
\[12]And when they lifted up their eyes far off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
\[13]So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.

fter this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
\[2]And Job spoke, and said,
\[3]Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a male child conceived.
\[4]Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
\[5]Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
\[6]As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
\[7]Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
\[8]Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
\[9]Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
\[10]Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
\[11]Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the spirit when I came out of the belly?
\[12]Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
\[13]For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
\[14]With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;
\[15]Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
\[16]Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
\[17]There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
\[18]There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
\[19]The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
\[20]Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
\[21]Which long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
\[22]Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
\[23]Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?
\[24]For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
\[25]For the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has come unto me.
\[26]I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

\[2]If we analyse to commune with you, will you be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
\[3]Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.
\[4]Your words have raised up him that was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.
\[5]But now it has come upon you, and you faint; it touches you, and you are troubled.
\[6]Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?
\[7]Remember, I pray you, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
\[8]Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
\[9]By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
\[10]The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
\[11]The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
\[12]Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
\[13]In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
\[14]Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
\[15]Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
\[16]It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
\[17]Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
\[18]Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
\[19]How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
\[20]They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.

\[4]His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
\[5]Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their substance.

\[18]For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole.
\[19]He shall deliver you in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch you.
\[20]In famine he shall redeem you from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
\[21]You shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
\[22]At destruction and famine you shall laugh: neither shall you be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
\[23]For you shall be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
\[24]And you shall know that your tabernacle shall be in peace; and you shall visit your habitation, and shall not sin.
\[25]You shall know also that your seed shall be great, and yours offspring as the grass of the earth.

\[12]Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
\[13]Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

\[5]O that all of you would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
\[6]Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
\[7]Will all of you speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
\[8]Will all of you accept his person? will all of you contend for God?
\[9]Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocks another, do all of you so mock him?
\[10]He will surely reprove you, if all of you do secretly accept persons.
\[11]Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
\[12]Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
\[13]Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
\[14]Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
\[15]Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
\[16]He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
\[17]Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
\[18]Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
\[19]Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the spirit.
\[20]Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from you.
\[21]Withdraw yours hand far from me: and let not your dread make me afraid.
\[22]Then call you, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer you me.
\[23]How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
\[24]Wherefore hide you your face, and hold me for yours enemy?
\[25]Will you break a leaf driven back and forth? and will you pursue the dry stubble?
\[26]For you write bitter things against me, and make me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
\[27]You put my feet also in the stocks, and look narrowly unto all my paths; you set a print upon the heels of my feet.

\[26]He runs upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
\[27]Because he covers his face with his fatness, and makes fatness on his flanks.
\[28]And he dwells in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabits, which are ready to become heaps.
\[29]He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
\[30]He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
\[31]Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
\[32]It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
\[33]He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
\[34]For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

\[3]All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
\[4]My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
\[5]God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
\[6]My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
\[7]Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous.
\[8]For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?
\[9]Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?
\[10]Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
\[11]I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
\[12]Behold, all you yourselves have seen it; why then are all of you thus altogether vain?
\[13]This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
\[14]If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
\[15]Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
\[16]Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
\[17]He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
\[18]He builds his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper makes.
\[19]The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he opens his eyes, and he is not.
\[20]Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest steals him away in the night.
\[21]The east wind carries him away, and he departs: and as a storm hurls him out of his place.

\[3]Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
\[4]Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
\[5]When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
\[6]And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and all of you are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you mine opinion.

\[8]But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.

\[19]He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
\[20]So that his life detests bread, and his soul dainty food.
\[21]His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
\[22]Yea, his soul draws near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
\[23]If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness:
\[24]Then he is gracious unto him, and says, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
\[25]His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
\[26]He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
\[27]He looks upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
\[28]He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
\[29]Lo, all these things works God oftentimes with man,
\[30]To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
\[31]Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold your peace, and I will speak.

\[15]All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return unto dust.
\[16]If now you have understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
\[17]Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you condemn him that is most just?

\[20]In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
\[21]For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he sees all his activities.
\[22]There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
\[23]For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
\[24]He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their position.
\[25]Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
\[26]He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
\[27]Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
\[28]So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.
\[29]When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
\[30]That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
\[31]Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
\[32]That which I see not teach you me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
\[33]Should it be according to your mind? he will recompense it, whether you refuse, or whether you choose; and not I: therefore speak what you know.
\[34]Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
\[35]Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.

\[3]He directs it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
\[4]After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
\[5]God thunders marvellously with his voice; great things does he, which we cannot comprehend.
\[6]For he says to the snow, Be you on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
\[7]He seals up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.

\[12]And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commands them upon the face of the world in the earth.
\[13]He causes it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
\[14]Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
\[15]Do you know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
\[16]Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
\[17]How your garments are warm, when he stills the earth by the south wind?
\[18]Have you with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
\[19]Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
\[20]Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
\[21]And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passes, and cleanses them.
\[22]Fair weather comes out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
\[23]Concerning the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
\[24]Men do therefore fear him: he respects not any that are wise of heart.

\[7]When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
\[8]Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
\[9]When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,
\[10]And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
\[11]And said, Until now shall you come, but no further: and here shall your proud waves be stayed?
\[12]Have you commanded the morning since your days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
\[13]That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
\[14]It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
\[15]And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.

\[17]Have the gates of death been opened unto you? or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?
\[18]Have you perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if you know it all.

\[20]That you should take it to the bound thereof, and that you should know the paths to the house thereof?
\[21]Know you it, because you were then born? or because the number of your days is great?
\[22]Have you entered into the treasures of the snow? or have you seen the treasures of the hail,
\[23]Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
\[24]By what way is the light parted, which scatters the east wind upon the earth?
\[25]Who has divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
\[26]To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
\[27]To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
\[28]Has the rain a father? or who has begotten the drops of dew?
\[29]Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who has gendered it?
\[30]The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
\[31]Can you bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
\[32]Can you bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or can you guide Arcturus with his sons?

\[38]When the dust grows into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
\[39]Will you hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
\[40]When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?

\[3]Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
\[4]Hear, I plead to you, and I will speak: I will demand of you, and declare you unto me.
\[5]I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye sees you.
\[6]Wherefore I detest myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
\[7]And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for all of you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
\[8]Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that all of you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
\[9]So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
\[10]And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
\[11]Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
\[12]So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
\[13]He had also seven sons and three daughters.
\[14]And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
\[15]And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
\[16]After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
\[17]So Job died, being old and full of days.

\[7]Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was angry.
\[8]There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\[9]He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.

\[33]He makes my feet like hinds' feet, and sets me upon my high places.
\[34]He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

\[37]I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I return till they were consumed.
\[38]I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
\[39]For you have girded me with strength unto the battle: you have subdued under me those that rose up against me.
\[40]You have also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
\[41]They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
\[42]Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
\[43]You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; and you have made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
\[44]As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
\[45]The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.

\[24]Pour out yours indignation upon them, and let your wrathful anger take hold of them.
\[25]Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
\[26]For they persecute him whom you have smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom you have wounded.
\[27]Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into your righteousness.
\[28]Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.

\[3]Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\[4]We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.
\[5]For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
\[6]That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
\[7]That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
\[8]And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
\[9]The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\[10]They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
\[11]And forgotten about his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.
\[12]Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
\[13]He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
\[14]In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
\[15]He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
\[16]He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\[17]And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
\[18]And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their lust.
\[19]Yea, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
\[20]Behold, he stroke the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
\[21]Therefore the LORD heard this, and was angry: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
\[22]Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
\[23]Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
\[24]And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
\[25]Man did eat angels' food: he sent them food to the full.
\[26]He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
\[27]He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like the sand of the sea:
\[28]And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
\[29]So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
\[30]They were not cut off from their lust. But while their food was yet in their mouths,
\[31]The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and stroke down the chosen men of Israel.
\[32]For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
\[33]Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
\[34]When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
\[35]And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
\[36]Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
\[37]For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
\[38]But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
\[39]For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passes away, and comes not again.
\[40]How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
\[41]Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
\[42]They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
\[43]How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
\[44]And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
\[45]He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
\[46]He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.
\[47]He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
\[48]He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\[49]He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
\[50]He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
\[51]And stroke all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
\[52]But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\[53]And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\[54]And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
\[55]He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\[56]Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
\[57]But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\[58]For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
\[59]When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel:
\[60]So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
\[61]And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
\[62]He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was angry with his inheritance.
\[63]The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
\[64]Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
\[65]Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.
\[66]And he stroke his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
\[67]Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
\[68]But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
\[69]And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he has established for ever.
\[70]He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
\[71]From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\[72]So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

\[18]And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
\[19]They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

\[21]They forgotten about God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
\[22]Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
\[23]Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
\[24]Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
\[25]But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
\[26]Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
\[27]To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
\[28]They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\[29]Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
\[30]Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
\[31]And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
\[32]They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
\[33]Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke without due consideration with his lips.
\[34]They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
\[35]But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
\[36]And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
\[37]Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
\[38]And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
\[39]Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
\[40]Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
\[41]And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
\[42]Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
\[43]Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
\[44]Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
\[45]And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
\[46]He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

\[35]He turns the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into fountains.
\[36]And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;

old not your peace, O God of my praise;
\[2]For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
\[3]They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
\[4]For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.

\[8]Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
\[9]Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
\[10]Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
\[11]Let the extortionist catch all that he has; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
\[12]Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
\[13]Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
\[14]Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
\[15]Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
\[16]Because that he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
\[17]As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
\[18]As he clothed himself with cursing like with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
\[19]Let it be unto him as the garment which covers him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
\[20]Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
\[21]But do you for me, O GOD the Lord, for your name's sake: because your mercy is good, deliver you me.
\[22]For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
\[23]I am gone like the shadow when it declines: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
\[24]My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh fails of fatness.
\[25]I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shook their heads.
\[26]Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to your mercy:
\[27]That they may know that this is your hand; that you, LORD, have done it.
\[28]Let them curse, but bless you: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let your servant rejoice.
\[29]Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
\[30]I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

he proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
\[2]To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
\[3]To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
\[4]To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
\[5]A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
\[6]To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
\[7]The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
\[8]My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:
\[9]For they shall be an ornament of grace unto your head, and chains about your neck.
\[10]My son, if sinners entice you, consent you not.
\[11]If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privately for the innocent without cause:
\[12]Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
\[13]We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
\[14]Cast in your lot among us; let us all have one purse:
\[15]My son, walk not you in the way with them; refrain your foot from their path:
\[16]For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
\[17]Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
\[18]And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privately for their own lives.
\[19]So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which takes away the life of the owners thereof.
\[20]Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:
\[21]She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she utters her words, saying,
\[22]How long, all of you simple ones, will all of you love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
\[23]Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
\[24]Because I have called, and all of you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
\[25]But all of you have set at nothing all my counsel, and refused my reproof:
\[26]I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes;
\[27]When your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes upon you.
\[28]Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
\[29]For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
\[30]They refused my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
\[31]Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
\[32]For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
\[33]But whoso hearkens unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

\[4]If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;
\[5]Then shall you understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
\[6]For the LORD gives wisdom: out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
\[7]He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
\[8]He keeps the paths of judgment, and perserves the way of his saints.
\[9]Then shall you understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
\[10]When wisdom enters into yours heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto your soul;
\[11]Discretion shall preserve you, understanding shall keep you:
\[12]To deliver you from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaks perverse things;
\[13]Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
\[14]Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of the wicked;
\[15]Whose ways are crooked, and they perverse in their paths:
\[16]To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words;
\[17]Which forsakes the guide of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.
\[18]For her house inclines unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
\[19]None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
\[20]That you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
\[21]For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

\[12]For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.
\[13]Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.
\[14]For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
\[15]She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared unto her.

\[17]Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
\[18]She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retains her.
\[19]The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.
\[20]By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
\[21]My son, let not them depart from yours eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
\[22]So shall they be life unto your soul, and grace to your neck.
\[23]Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.
\[24]When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yea, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.
\[25]Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.
\[26]For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.
\[27]Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of yours hand to do it.
\[28]Say not unto your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you.
\[29]Devise not evil against your neighbour, seeing he dwells securely by you.
\[30]Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done you no harm.
\[31]Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
\[32]For the perverse is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
\[33]The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.
\[34]Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace unto the lowly.

\[24]To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
\[25]Lust not after her beauty in yours heart; neither let her take you with her eyelids.

\[28]Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

\[30]Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
\[31]But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
\[32]But whoso commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding: he that does it destroys his own soul.
\[33]A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

ine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
\[2]The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provokes him to anger sins against his own soul.
\[3]It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
\[4]The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.
\[5]Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
\[6]Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
\[7]The just man walks in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.
\[8]A king that sits in the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes.
\[9]Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
\[10]Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.
\[11]Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
\[12]The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD has made even both of them.
\[13]Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty; open yours eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.
\[14]It is nil, it is nil, says the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.
\[15]There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
\[16]Take his garment that is guarantor for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
\[17]Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
\[18]Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.
\[19]He that goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flatters with his lips.
\[20]Whoso curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
\[21]An inheritance may be got hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
\[22]Say not you, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save you.
\[23]Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.
\[24]Man's activities are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?
\[25]It is a snare to the man who devours that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.
\[26]A wise king scatters the wicked, and brings the wheel over them.
\[27]The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
\[28]Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne supported by mercy.
\[29]The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head.
\[30]The blueness of a wound cleanses away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.

\[2]Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD ponders the hearts.
\[3]To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
\[4]An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.
\[5]The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to lack.
\[6]The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed back and forth of them that seek death.
\[7]The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
\[8]The way of man is perverse and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.
\[9]It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
\[10]The soul of the wicked desires evil: his neighbour finds no favour in his eyes.
\[11]When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
\[12]The righteous man wisely considers the house of the wicked: but God overthrows the wicked for their wickedness.
\[13]Whoso stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
\[14]A gift in secret pacifies anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
\[15]It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
\[16]The man that wanders out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
\[17]He that loves pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loves wine and oil shall not be rich.
\[18]The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
\[19]It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.
\[20]There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spends it up.
\[21]He that follows after righteousness and mercy finds life, righteousness, and honour.
\[22]A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and casts down the strength of the confidence thereof.
\[23]Whoso keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
\[24]Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who deals in proud wrath.
\[25]The desire of the slothful kills him; for his hands refuse to labour.
\[26]He covers greedily all the day long: but the righteous gives and spares not.
\[27]The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind?
\[28]A false witness shall perish: but the man that hears speaks constantly.
\[29]A wicked man hardens his face: but as for the upright, he directs his way.
\[30]There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.
\[31]The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.

\[20]Have not I written to you excellent things in counsels and knowledge,
\[21]That I might make you know the certainty of the words of truth; that you might answer the words of truth to them that send unto you?
\[22]Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
\[23]For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.
\[24]Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man you shall not go:
\[25]Lest you learn his ways, and get a snare to your soul.
\[26]Be not you one of them that shake hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.
\[27]If you have nothing to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?

\[2]It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.
\[3]The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
\[4]Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
\[5]Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
\[6]Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:
\[7]For better it is that it be said unto you, Come up here; than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom yours eyes have seen.
\[8]Go not forth hastily to strive, lest you know not what to do in the end thereof, when your neighbour has put you to shame.
\[9]Debate your cause with your neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:
\[10]Lest he that hears it put you to shame, and yours ill repute turn not away.
\[11]A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
\[12]As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
\[13]As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his masters.
\[14]Whoso boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.
\[15]By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.
\[16]Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.
\[17]Withdraw your foot from your neighbour's house; lest he be weary of you, and so hate you.
\[18]A man that bears false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
\[19]Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
\[20]As he that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon alkali, so is he that sings songs to an heavy heart.
\[21]If yours enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
\[22]For you shall heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward you.
\[23]The north wind drives away rain: so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
\[24]It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
\[25]As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
\[26]A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

\[16]The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
\[17]He that passes by, and meddles with strife belonging not to him, is like one that takes a dog by the ears.
\[18]As a mad man who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,
\[19]So is the man that deceives his neighbour, and says, Am not I in sport?
\[20]Where no wood is, there the fire goes out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceases.
\[21]As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
\[22]The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
\[23]Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
\[24]He that hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;
\[25]When he speaks fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
\[26]Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation.

\[18]Whoso keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waits on his master shall be honoured.
\[19]As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man.
\[20]Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
\[21]As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.

\[4]Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if you can tell?
\[5]Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
\[6]Add you not unto his words, lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.
\[7]Two things have I required of you; deny me them not before I die:
\[8]Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
\[9]Lest I be full, and deny you, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
\[10]Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.
\[11]There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
\[12]There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
\[13]There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
\[14]There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
\[15]The horseleach has two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:
\[16]The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that says not, It is enough.
\[17]The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
\[18]There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
\[19]The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
\[20]Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness.
\[21]For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:
\[22]For a servant when he reigns; and a fool when he is filled with food;
\[23]For an abhorrent woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
\[24]There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
\[25]The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;
\[26]The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
\[27]The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
\[28]The spider takes hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
\[29]There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
\[30]A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turns not away for any;
\[31]A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
\[32]If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have thought evil, lay yours hand upon your mouth.
\[33]Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood: so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.

\[2]What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
\[3]Give not your strength unto women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
\[4]It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
\[5]Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
\[6]Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
\[7]Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
\[8]Open your mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
\[9]Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
\[10]Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.
\[11]The heart of her husband does safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
\[12]She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
\[13]She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
\[14]She is like the merchants' ships; she brings her food from far.
\[15]She rises also while it is yet night, and gives food to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
\[16]She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
\[17]She girds her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms.
\[18]She perceives that her merchandise is good: her candle goes not out by night.
\[19]She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
\[20]She stretches out her hand to the poor; yea, she reachs forth her hands to the needy.
\[21]She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
\[22]She makes herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.
\[23]Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.
\[24]She makes fine linen, and sells it; and delivers girdles unto the merchant.
\[25]Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
\[26]She opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
\[27]She looks well to the ways of her household, and eats not the bread of idleness.
\[28]Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her.
\[29]Many daughters have done virtuously, but you excel them all.
\[30]Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that fears the LORD, she shall be praised.
\[31]Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.

he words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
\[2]Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
\[3]What profit has a man of all his labour which he takes under the sun?
\[4]One generation passes away, and another generation comes: but the earth abides for ever.
\[5]The sun also arises, and the sun goes down, and hastes to his place where he arose.
\[6]The wind goes toward the south, and turns about unto the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to his circuits.
\[7]All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
\[8]All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
\[9]The thing that has been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
\[10]Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it has been already of old time, which was before us.
\[11]There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.
\[12]I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\[13]And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
\[14]I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
\[15]That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.
\[16]I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have got more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
\[17]And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.
\[18]For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.

 said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove you with delight, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.
\[2]I said of laughter, It is mad: and of delight, What does it?
\[3]I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
\[4]I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards:
\[5]I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:
\[6]I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that brings forth trees:
\[7]I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
\[8]I gathered me also silver and gold, and the exclusive treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
\[9]So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
\[10]And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
\[11]Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
\[12]And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that comes after the king? even that which has been already done.
\[13]Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
\[14]The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happens to them all.
\[15]Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.
\[16]For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dies the wise man? as the fool.
\[17]Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
\[18]Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
\[19]And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.
\[20]Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
\[21]For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that has not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
\[22]For what has man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he has laboured under the sun?
\[23]For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart takes not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
\[24]There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.
\[25]For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
\[26]For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

o every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
\[2]A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
\[3]A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
\[4]A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
\[5]A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
\[6]A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
\[7]A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
\[8]A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
\[9]What profit has he that works in that wherein he labours?
\[10]I have seen the travail, which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
\[11]He has made every thing beautiful in his time: also he has set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end.
\[12]I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
\[13]And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.
\[14]I know that, whatsoever God does, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God does it, that men should fear before him.
\[15]That which has been is now; and that which is to be has already been; and God requires that which is past.
\[16]And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
\[17]I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
\[18]I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
\[19]For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.
\[20]All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
\[21]Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?
\[22]Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

\[2]Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
\[3]Yea, better is he than either of them, which has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
\[4]Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.
\[5]The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.
\[6]Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.

\[8]There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither says he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
\[9]Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
\[10]For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falls; for he has not another to help him up.
\[11]Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?
\[12]And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
\[13]Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
\[14]For out of prison he comes to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becomes poor.
\[15]I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his position.
\[16]There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

eep your foot when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
\[2]Be not rash with your mouth, and let not yours heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and you upon earth: therefore let your words be few.
\[3]For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.
\[4]When you vow a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools: pay that which you have vowed.
\[5]Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.
\[6]Suffer not your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; neither say you before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of yours hands?
\[7]For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear you God.
\[8]If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regards; and there be higher than they.
\[9]Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.
\[10]He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance with increase: this is also vanity.
\[11]When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?
\[12]The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
\[13]There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
\[14]But those riches perish by evil travail: and he bring forths a son, and there is nothing in his hand.
\[15]As he came out of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
\[16]And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit has he that has laboured for the wind?
\[17]All his days also he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
\[18]Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him: for it is his portion.
\[19]Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

\[3]Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
\[4]The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of delight.
\[5]It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

\[10]Say not you, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not enquire wisely concerning this.
\[11]Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.
\[12]For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to them that have it.
\[13]Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?
\[14]In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has set the one opposite to the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
\[15]All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness.
\[16]Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you destroy yourself ?
\[17]Be not over much wicked, neither be you foolish: why should you die before your time?
\[18]It is good that you should take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not yours hand: for he that fears God shall come out of them all.
\[19]Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.
\[20]For there is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not.
\[21]Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you:
\[22]For oftentimes also yours own heart knows that you yourself likewise have cursed others.
\[23]All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
\[24]That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
\[25]I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:
\[26]And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

\[3]Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he does whatsoever pleases him.
\[4]Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What do you?
\[5]Whoso keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment.
\[6]Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.
\[7]For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
\[8]There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither has he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
\[9]All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man rules over another to his own hurt.
\[10]And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.
\[11]Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
\[12]Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
\[13]But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he fears not before God.
\[14]There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.
\[15]Then I commended delight, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.
\[16]When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes:)
\[17]Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.

or all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them.
\[2]All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swears, as he that fears an oath.
\[3]This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
\[4]In order to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
\[5]For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.

\[10]Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you go.

\[12]For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.
\[13]This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:
\[14]There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
\[15]Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
\[16]Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
\[17]The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that rules among fools.
\[18]Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroys much good.

ead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so does a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.
\[2]A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.
\[3]Yea also, when he that is a fool walks by the way, his wisdom fails him, and he says to every one that he is a fool.
\[4]If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place; for yielding pacifies great offences.
\[5]There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceeds from the ruler:
\[6]Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
\[7]I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.
\[8]He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
\[9]Whoso removes stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaves wood shall be endangered thereby.
\[10]If the iron be blunt, and he do not sharpen the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
\[11]Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
\[12]The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
\[13]The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
\[14]A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
\[15]The labour of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city.
\[16]Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!
\[17]Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
\[18]By much slothfulness the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.
\[19]A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry: but money answers all things.
\[20]Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.

\[4]He that observes the wind shall not sow; and he that regards the clouds shall not reap.
\[5]As you know not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so you know not the works of God who makes all.
\[6]In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not yours hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

\[3]In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,

\[7]Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.
\[8]Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all is vanity.
\[9]And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.
\[10]The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.
\[11]The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.
\[12]And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
\[13]Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

\[2]Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
\[3]The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.
\[4]Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
\[5]Why should all of you be stricken any more? all of you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
\[6]From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and rotting sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
\[7]Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
\[8]And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
\[9]Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
\[10]Hear the word of the LORD, all of you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, all of you people of Gomorrah.
\[11]To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? says the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
\[12]When all of you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
\[13]Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
\[14]Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
\[15]And when all of you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when all of you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
\[16]Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
\[17]Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
\[18]Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
\[19]If all of you be willing and obedient, all of you shall eat the good of the land:
\[20]But if all of you refuse and rebel, all of you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.
\[21]How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
\[22]Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:
\[23]Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.
\[24]Therefore says the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
\[25]And I will turn my hand upon you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:
\[26]And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
\[27]Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
\[28]And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.

\[4]And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
\[5]O house of Jacob, come all of you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.

\[19]And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake terribly the earth.

\[3]The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
\[4]And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
\[5]And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
\[6]When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, You have clothing, be you our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand:
\[7]In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
\[8]For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
\[9]The show of their countenance does witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

\[11]Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.

\[14]The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for all of you have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
\[15]What mean all of you that all of you beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord GOD of hosts.
\[16]Moreover the LORD says, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and moving enticingly as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:
\[17]Therefore the LORD will strike with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.
\[18]In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,
\[19]The chains, and the bracelets, and the covering for the lower part of the face,
\[20]The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,

\[22]The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
\[23]The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.
\[25]Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.

ow will I sing to my beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
\[2]And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the best vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
\[3]And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.
\[4]What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
\[5]And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
\[6]And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dug; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
\[7]For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
\[8]Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
\[9]In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Truthfully many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
\[10]Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
\[11]Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!
\[12]And the harp, and the viol, the timbrel, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.
\[13]Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
\[14]Therefore hell has enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoices, shall descend into it.
\[15]And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
\[16]But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
\[17]Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
\[18]Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:
\[19]That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
\[20]Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
\[21]Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
\[22]Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
\[23]Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
\[24]Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
\[25]Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
\[26]And he will lift up an explicit sign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
\[27]None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
\[28]Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:
\[29]Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.
\[30]And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

\[2]Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.
\[3]And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
\[4]And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
\[5]Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
\[6]Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
\[7]And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and yours iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.
\[8]Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
\[9]And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear all of you indeed, but understand not; and see all of you indeed, but perceive not.
\[10]Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
\[11]Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
\[12]And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
\[13]But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.

nd it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
\[2]And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
\[3]Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the launderer's field;
\[4]And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
\[5]Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against you, saying,
\[6]Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:
\[7]Thus says the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
\[8]For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
\[9]And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If all of you will not believe, surely all of you shall not be established.
\[10]Moreover the LORD spoke again unto Ahaz, saying,
\[11]Ask you a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
\[12]But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
\[13]And he said, Hear all of you now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will all of you weary my God also?
\[14]Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
\[15]Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
\[16]For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.
\[17]The LORD shall bring upon you, and upon your people, and upon your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
\[18]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
\[19]And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
\[20]In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
\[22]And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
\[23]And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver coins, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
\[24]With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
\[25]And on all hills that shall be dug with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending out of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

\[3]And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.
\[4]For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

\[9]Associate yourselves, O all of you people, and all of you shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all you of far countries: gird yourselves, and all of you shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and all of you shall be broken in pieces.
\[10]Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
\[11]For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
\[12]Say all of you not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear all of you their fear, nor be afraid.
\[13]Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
\[14]And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a animal trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[15]And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
\[16]Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
\[17]And I will wait upon the LORD, that hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
\[18]Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwells in mount Zion.

\[19]And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.

\[8]And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that labors: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.
\[9]Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
\[10]For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
\[11]And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
\[12]I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
\[13]Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.
\[14]And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man takes up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.

\[18]Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.
\[19]And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
\[20]It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
\[21]But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

\[23]I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, says the LORD of hosts.
\[24]The LORD of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:
\[25]That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
\[26]This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

\[28]In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
\[29]Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that stroke you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.
\[30]And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall slay your remnant.
\[31]Wail, O gate; cry, O city; you, whole Palestina, are dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.

\[15]Wherefore glorify all of you the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.
\[16]From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
\[17]Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.
\[18]And it shall come to pass, that he who flees from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
\[19]The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.
\[20]The earth shall reel back and forth like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.
\[22]And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.
\[23]Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.

\[2]For you have made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
\[3]Therefore shall the strong people glorify you, the city of the terrible nations shall fear you.
\[4]For you have been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
\[5]You shall bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
\[6]And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the sediments of wine, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the sediments of wine well refined.
\[7]And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.
\[8]He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD has spoken it.
\[9]And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
\[10]For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
\[11]And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swins spreads forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.

\[3]The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:
\[4]And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looks upon it sees, while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.
\[5]In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,
\[6]And for a spirit of judgment to him that sits in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
\[7]But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they go astray in vision, they stumble in judgment.
\[8]For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.

\[13]But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
\[14]Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, all of you scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.
\[15]Because all of you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
\[16]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.
\[17]Judgment also will I apply to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
\[18]And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then all of you shall be trodden down by it.
\[19]From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.
\[20]For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
\[21]For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
\[22]Now therefore be all of you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
\[23]Give all of you ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
\[24]Does the plowman plow all day to sow? does he open and break the clods of his ground?
\[25]When he has made plain the face thereof, does he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the spelt in their place?
\[26]For his God does instruct him to discretion, and does teach him.
\[27]For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
\[28]Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.

\[7]And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
\[8]It shall even be as when an hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
\[9]Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry all of you out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
\[10]For the LORD has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.
\[11]And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he says, I cannot; for it is sealed:
\[12]And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he says, I am not learned.
\[13]Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
\[14]Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
\[15]Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us?

\[17]Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
\[18]And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
\[19]The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

\[22]Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
\[23]But when he sees his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

\[11]Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
\[12]Wherefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because all of you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:
\[13]Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly at an instant.
\[14]And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a potsherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water likewise out of the pit.
\[15]For thus says the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall all of you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and all of you would not.
\[16]But all of you said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall all of you flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
\[17]One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall all of you flee: till all of you be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an explicit sign on an hill.
\[18]And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.
\[19]For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: you shall weep no more: he will be very gracious unto you at the voice of your cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer you.
\[20]And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not your teachers be removed into a corner any more, but yours eyes shall see your teachers:
\[21]And yours ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk all of you in it, when all of you turn to the right hand, and when all of you turn to the left.
\[22]All of you shall defile also the covering of your graven images of silver, and the ornament of your molten images of gold: you shall cast them away as a menstruous cloth; you shall say unto it, Get you behind.

\[24]The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean animal food, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
\[25]And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
\[26]Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the breach of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.
\[27]Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:
\[28]And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to go astray.
\[29]All of you shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.
\[30]And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
\[31]For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which stroke with a rod.
\[32]And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with timbrels and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

ome near, all of you nations, to hear; and hearken, all of you people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come out of it.
\[2]For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he has utterly destroyed them, he has delivered them to the slaughter.
\[3]Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
\[4]And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.
\[5]For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
\[6]The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
\[7]And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
\[8]For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
\[9]And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
\[10]It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
\[11]But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
\[12]They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
\[13]And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.
\[14]The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
\[15]There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
\[16]Seek all of you out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall lack her mate: for my mouth it has commanded, and his spirit it has gathered them.
\[17]And he has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

\[2]It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.
\[3]Strengthen all of you the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
\[4]Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.
\[5]Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
\[6]Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
\[7]And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
\[8]And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the travelling men, though fools, shall not go astray therein.
\[9]No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:
\[10]And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

ow it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
\[2]And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the launderer's field.
\[3]Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
\[4]And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say all of you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?
\[5]I say, says you, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?
\[6]Lo, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
\[7]But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, All of you shall worship before this altar?
\[8]Now therefore give pledges, I pray you, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders upon them.
\[9]How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\[10]And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\[11]Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, unto your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
\[12]But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
\[13]Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear all of you the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\[14]Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
\[15]Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[16]Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat all of you every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink all of you every one the waters of his own cistern;
\[17]Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\[18]Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
\[19]Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\[20]Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\[21]But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\[22]Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

nd it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
\[2]And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
\[3]And they said unto him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\[4]It may be the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: wherefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.
\[5]So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\[6]And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall all of you say unto your master, Thus says the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that you have heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\[7]Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
\[8]So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\[9]And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\[10]Thus shall all of you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\[11]Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shall you be delivered?
\[12]Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?
\[13]Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
\[14]And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
\[15]And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,
\[16]O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwell between the cherubims, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: you have made heaven and earth.
\[17]Incline yours ear, O LORD, and hear; open yours eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which has sent to reproach the living God.
\[18]Truthfully, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
\[19]And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
\[20]Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are the LORD, even you only.
\[21]Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
\[22]This is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
\[23]Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up yours eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
\[24]By your servants have you reproached the Lord, and have said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.
\[25]I have dug, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
\[26]Have you not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you should be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.
\[27]Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
\[28]But I know your abode, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against me.
\[29]Because your rage against me, and your tumult, has come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
\[30]And this shall be a sign unto you, All of you shall eat this year such as grows of itself; and the second year that which springs of the same: and in the third year sow all of you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
\[31]And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
\[32]For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
\[33]Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.
\[34]By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, says the LORD.
\[35]For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
\[36]Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and stroke in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
\[37]So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
\[38]And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons stroke him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his position.

n those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Set yours house in order: for you shall die, and not live.
\[2]Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
\[3]And said, Remember now, O LORD, I plead to you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
\[4]Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
\[5]Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will add unto your days fifteen years.
\[6]And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
\[7]And this shall be a sign unto you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken;
\[8]Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
\[9]The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
\[10]I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
\[11]I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
\[12]Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night will you make an end of me.
\[13]I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night will you make an end of me.
\[14]Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
\[15]What shall I say? he has both spoken unto me, and himself has done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
\[16]O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so will you recover me, and make me to live.
\[17]Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but you have in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
\[18]For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.
\[19]The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known your truth.
\[20]The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
\[21]For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.
\[22]Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?

t that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
\[2]And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
\[3]Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
\[4]Then said he, What have they seen in yours house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
\[5]Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
\[6]Behold, the days come, that all that is in yours house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
\[7]And of your sons that shall issue from you, which you shall brought forth, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
\[8]Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

\[5]And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.

\[7]The grass withers, the flower fades: because the spirit of the LORD blows upon it: surely the people is grass.
\[8]The grass withers, the flower fades: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
\[9]O Zion, that bring good tidings, get you up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bring good tidings, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
\[10]Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
\[11]He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.
\[12]Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
\[13]Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor has taught him?
\[14]With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?
\[15]Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.
\[16]And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
\[17]All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

\[26]Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.

\[28]Have you not known? have you not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faints not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
\[29]He gives power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increases strength.

\[17]They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, All of you are our gods.
\[18]Hear, all of you deaf; and look, all of you blind, that all of you may see.
\[19]Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?
\[20]Seeing many things, but you observe not; opening the ears, but he hears not.
\[21]The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.
\[22]But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none says, Restore.
\[23]Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?
\[24]Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.
\[25]Therefore he has poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it has set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

ut now thus says the LORD that created you, O Jacob, and he that formed you, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name; you are mine.
\[2]When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you: when you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon you.
\[3]For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour: I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.
\[4]Since you were precious in my sight, you have been honourable, and I have loved you: therefore will I give men for you, and people for your life.
\[5]Fear not: for I am with you: I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west;
\[6]I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
\[7]Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
\[8]Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
\[9]Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
\[10]All of you are my witnesses, says the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that all of you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
\[11]I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.
\[12]I have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore all of you are my witnesses, says the LORD, that I am God.
\[13]Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?
\[14]Thus says the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.
\[15]I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
\[16]Thus says the LORD, which makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
\[17]Which brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
\[18]Remember all of you not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
\[19]Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall all of you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
\[20]The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
\[21]This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.
\[22]But you have not called upon me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel.
\[23]You have not brought me the small cattle of your burnt offerings; neither have you honoured me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.
\[24]You have bought me no sweet cane with money, neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices: but you have made me to serve with your sins, you have wearied me with yours iniquities.
\[25]I, even I, am he that blots out your transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember your sins.
\[26]Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare you, that you may be justified.
\[27]Your first father has sinned, and your teachers have transgressed against me.
\[28]Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

et now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
\[2]Thus says the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb, which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and you, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
\[3]For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon your seed, and my blessing upon yours offspring:
\[4]And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.
\[5]One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.
\[6]Thus says the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.
\[7]And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them.
\[8]Fear all of you not, neither be afraid: have not I told you from that time, and have declared it? all of you are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.
\[9]They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
\[10]Who has formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?
\[11]Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.
\[12]The smith with the tongs both works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength fails: he drinks no water, and is faint.
\[13]The carpenter stretches out his rule; he marks it out with a line; he fits it with planes, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
\[14]He hews him down cedars, and takes the cypress and the oak, which he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest: he plants an ash, and the rain does nourish it.
\[15]Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindles it, and bakes bread; yea, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it a graven image, and falls down thereto.
\[16]He burns part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eats flesh; he roasts roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warms himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:
\[17]And the residue thereof he makes a god, even his graven image: he falls down unto it, and worships it, and prays unto it, and says, Deliver me; for you are my god.
\[18]They have not known nor understood: for he has shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
\[19]And none considers in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
\[20]He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
\[21]Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant: I have formed you; you are my servant: O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of me.
\[22]I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed you.
\[23]Sing, O all of you heavens; for the LORD has done it: shout, all of you lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, all of you mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
\[24]Thus says the LORD, your redeemer, and he that formed you from the womb, I am the LORD that makes all things; that stretches forth the heavens alone; that spreads abroad the earth by myself;
\[25]That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;
\[26]That confirms the word of his servant, and performs the counsel of his messengers; that says to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, All of you shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:
\[27]That says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers:
\[28]That says of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.

hus says the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;
\[2]I will go before you, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in two the bars of iron:
\[3]And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, which call you by your name, am the God of Israel.
\[4]For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.
\[5]I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded you, though you have not known me:
\[6]That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.
\[7]I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
\[8]Drop down, all of you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.
\[9]Woe unto him that strives with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashions it, What make you? or your work, He has no hands?
\[10]Woe unto him that says unto his father, What brought forth you? or to the woman, What have you brought forth?
\[11]Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command all of you me.
\[12]I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
\[13]I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, says the LORD of hosts.
\[14]Thus says the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto you, and they shall be yours: they shall come after you; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto you, they shall make supplication unto you, saying, Surely God is in you; and there is none else, there is no God.
\[15]Verily you are a God that hide yourself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.
\[16]They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.
\[17]But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: all of you shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.
\[18]For thus says the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he has established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.
\[19]I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek all of you me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
\[20]Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, all of you that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.
\[21]Tell all of you, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who has declared this from ancient time? who has told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.
\[22]Look unto me, and be all of you saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
\[23]I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
\[24]Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.
\[25]In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.

ear all of you this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.
\[2]For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.
\[3]I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.
\[4]Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;
\[5]I have even from the beginning declared it to you; before it came to pass I showed it you: lest you should say, Mine idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.
\[6]You have heard, see all this; and will not all of you declare it? I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.
\[7]They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you heard them not; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.
\[8]Yea, you heard not; yea, you knew not; yea, from that time that yours ear was not opened: for I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.
\[9]For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I cut you not off.
\[10]Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.
\[11]For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.
\[12]Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.
\[13]Mine hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.
\[14]All you, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them has declared these things? The LORD has loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.
\[15]I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
\[16]Come all of you near unto me, hear all of you this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, has sent me.
\[17]Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD your God which teaches you to profit, which leads you by the way that you should go.
\[18]O that you had hearkened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:
\[19]Your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
\[20]Go all of you out of Babylon, flee all of you from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare all of you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say all of you, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.
\[21]And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

isten, O isles, unto me; and hearken, all of you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name.
\[2]And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;
\[3]And said unto me, You are my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
\[4]Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.
\[5]And now, says the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.
\[6]And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
\[7]Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation detests, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.
\[8]Thus says the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
\[9]That you may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.
\[10]They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
\[11]And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
\[12]Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
\[13]Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
\[14]But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.
\[15]Can a woman forget her nursing infant, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget you.
\[16]Behold, I have graven you upon the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.
\[17]Your children shall make haste; your destroyers and they that made you waste shall go out of you.
\[18]Lift up yours eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says the LORD, you shall surely clothe you with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on you, as a bride does.
\[19]For your waste and your desolate places, and the land of your destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed you up shall be far away.
\[20]The children which you shall have, after you have lost the other, shall say again in yours ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
\[21]Then shall you say in yours heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing back and forth? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
\[22]Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
\[23]And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
\[24]Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
\[25]But thus says the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contends with you, and I will save your children.
\[26]And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Saviour and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

\[7]Hearken unto me, all of you that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear all of you not the reproach of men, neither be all of you afraid of their revilings.
\[8]For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
\[9]Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?
\[10]Are you not it which has dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that has made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?
\[11]Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
\[12]I, even I, am he that comforts you: who are you, that you should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;
\[13]And forget the LORD your maker, that has stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and have feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?
\[14]The captive exile hastens that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
\[15]But I am the LORD your God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.
\[16]And I have put my words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, You are my people.
\[17]Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.
\[18]There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any that takes her by the hand of all the sons that she has brought up.
\[19]These two things are come unto you; who shall be sorry for you? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort you?
\[20]Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.
\[21]Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
\[22]Thus says your Lord the LORD, and your God that pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of yours hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you shall no more drink it again:
\[23]But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict you; which have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and you have laid your body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.

\[2]Shake yourself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose yourself from the bands of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
\[3]For thus says the LORD, All of you have sold yourselves for nothing; and all of you shall be redeemed without money.
\[4]For thus says the Lord GOD, My people went down in old times into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
\[5]Now therefore, what have I here, says the LORD, that my people is taken away for nothing? they that rule over them make them to wail, says the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.

\[7]How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that says unto Zion, Your God reigns!

\[9]Break forth into joy, sing together, all of you waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
\[10]The LORD has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
\[11]Depart all of you, depart all of you, go all of you out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go all of you out of the midst of her; be all of you clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.
\[12]For all of you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
\[13]Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
\[14]As many were astonished at you; his visage was so ruined more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:
\[15]So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.

\[2]For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor loveliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
\[3]He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
\[4]Surely he has borne our sicknesses, and carried our pains: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
\[5]But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
\[6]All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
\[7]He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.
\[8]He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
\[9]And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
\[10]Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
\[11]He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
\[12]Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

\[3]For you shall break forth on the right hand and on the left; and your seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
\[4]Fear not; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be you confounded; for you shall not be put to shame: for you shall forget the shame of your youth, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.
\[5]For your Maker is yours husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.

\[7]For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.
\[8]In a little wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on you, says the LORD your Redeemer.

\[10]For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, says the LORD that has mercy on you.
\[11]O you afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay your stones with fair colours, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
\[12]And I will make your windows of agates, and your gates of carbuncles, and all your borders of pleasant stones.
\[13]And all your children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of your children.
\[14]In righteousness shall you be established: you shall be far from oppression; for you shall not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near you.
\[15]Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against you shall fall for your sake.
\[16]Behold, I have created the smith that blows the coals in the fire, and that brings forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the destroyer to destroy.
\[17]No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, says the LORD.

ehold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
\[2]But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
\[3]For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perverseness.
\[4]None calls for justice, nor any pleads for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
\[5]They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
\[6]Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
\[7]Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.
\[8]The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their activities: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goes therein shall not know peace.
\[9]Therefore is judgment far from us, neither does justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.
\[10]We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.
\[11]We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
\[12]For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;
\[13]In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
\[14]And judgment is turned away backward, and justice stands far off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
\[15]Yea, truth fails; and he that departs from evil makes himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.
\[16]And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
\[17]For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
\[18]According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.
\[19]So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.
\[20]And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, says the LORD.
\[21]As for me, this is my covenant with them, says the LORD; My spirit that is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, says the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

\[9]But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
\[10]Go through, go through the gates; prepare all of you the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.
\[11]Behold, the LORD has proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say all of you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
\[12]And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and you shall be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.

ho is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
\[2]Wherefore are you red in yours apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the winepress?
\[3]I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.
\[4]For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.
\[5]And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
\[6]And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
\[7]I will mention the loving kindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
\[8]For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.
\[9]In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
\[10]But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.
\[11]Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?
\[12]That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
\[13]That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?
\[14]As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so did you lead your people, to make yourself a glorious name.
\[15]Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where is your zeal and your strength, the sounding of your bowels and of your mercies toward me? are they restrained?
\[16]Doubtless you are our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: you, O LORD, are our father, our redeemer; your name is from everlasting.
\[17]O LORD, why have you made us to go astray from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of yours inheritance.
\[18]The people of your holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
\[19]We are yours: you never bare rule over them; they were not called by your name.

h that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might flow down at your presence,
\[2]As when the melting fire burns, the fire causes the waters to boil, to make your name known to yours adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!
\[3]When you did terrible things which we looked not for, you came down, the mountains flowed down at your presence.
\[4]For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.

\[7]And there is none that calls upon your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of you: for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities.
\[8]But now, O LORD, you are our father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
\[9]Be not angry very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we plead to you, we are all your people.
\[10]Your holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
\[11]Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.

 am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.
\[2]I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walks in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;
\[3]A people that provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and burns incense upon altars of brick;
\[4]Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
\[5]Which say, Stand by yourself, come not near to me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.
\[6]Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
\[7]Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
\[8]Thus says the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.
\[9]And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
\[10]And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
\[11]But all of you are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
\[12]Therefore will I number you to the sword, and all of you shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, all of you did not answer; when I spoke, all of you did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.
\[13]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but all of you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but all of you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but all of you shall be ashamed:
\[14]Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but all of you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
\[15]And all of you shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay you, and call his servants by another name:
\[16]That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
\[17]For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
\[18]But be all of you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
\[19]And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
\[20]There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
\[21]And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
\[22]They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
\[23]They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
\[25]The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD.

\[2]For all those things has mine hand made, and all those things have been, says the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word.
\[3]He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.
\[4]I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.
\[5]Hear the word of the LORD, all of you that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
\[6]A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that renders recompence to his enemies.
\[7]Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a male child.
\[8]Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
\[9]Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? says your God.
\[10]Rejoice all of you with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her:
\[11]That all of you may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that all of you may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
\[12]For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall all of you suck, all of you shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.
\[13]As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and all of you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
\[14]And when all of you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.
\[15]For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\[16]For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
\[17]They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, says the LORD.
\[18]For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
\[19]And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles far off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
\[20]And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
\[21]And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.
\[22]For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says the LORD.
\[24]And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

he words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
\[2]To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\[3]It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
\[4]Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[5]Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet unto the nations.
\[6]Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.
\[7]But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for you shall go to all that I shall send you, and whatsoever I command you you shall speak.
\[8]Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD.
\[9]Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.
\[10]See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
\[11]Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
\[12]Then said the LORD unto me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
\[13]And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What see you? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.
\[14]Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
\[15]For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
\[16]And I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
\[17]You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command you: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them.
\[18]For, behold, I have made you this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
\[19]And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you, says the LORD, to deliver you.

oreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[2]Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of yours espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
\[3]Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, says the LORD.
\[4]Hear all of you the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
\[5]Thus says the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
\[6]Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?
\[7]And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when all of you entered, all of you defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
\[8]The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
\[9]Wherefore I will yet plead with you, says the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.
\[10]For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
\[11]Has a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
\[12]Be astonished, O all of you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be all of you very desolate, says the LORD.
\[13]For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\[14]Is Israel a servant? is he a native slave? why is he spoiled?
\[15]The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
\[16]Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of your head.
\[17]Have you not procured this unto yourself, in that you have forsaken the LORD your God, when he led you by the way?
\[18]And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?
\[19]Yours own wickedness shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that you have forsaken the LORD your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.
\[20]For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bands; and you said, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.
\[21]Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
\[22]For though you wash you with alkali, and take you much soap, yet yours iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord GOD.
\[23]How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
\[24]A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
\[25]Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
\[26]As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.
\[27]Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
\[28]But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.
\[29]Wherefore will all of you plead with me? all of you all have transgressed against me, says the LORD.
\[30]In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\[31]O generation, see all of you the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto you?
\[32]Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\[33]Why trim you your way to seek love? therefore have you also taught the wicked ones your ways.
\[34]Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocent persons: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
\[35]Yet you says, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you says, I have not sinned.
\[36]Why arm you about so much to change your way? you also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.
\[37]Yea, you shall go forth from him, and yours hands upon yours head: for the LORD has rejected your confidences, and you shall not prosper in them.

\[2]Lift up yours eyes unto the high places, and see where you have not been lien with. In the ways have you sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your whoredoms and with your wickedness.
\[3]Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.

\[7]And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
\[8]And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
\[9]And it came to pass through the levity of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
\[10]And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, says the LORD.
\[11]And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
\[12]Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, says the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.
\[13]Only acknowledge yours iniquity, that you have transgressed against the LORD your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and all of you have not obeyed my voice, says the LORD.
\[14]Turn, O backsliding children, says the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
\[15]And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, when all of you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.
\[17]At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.
\[18]In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.
\[19]But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, You shall call me, My father; and shall not turn away from me.
\[20]Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have all of you dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says the LORD.
\[21]A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.
\[22]Return, all of you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto you; for you are the LORD our God.
\[23]Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.
\[24]For shame has devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\[25]We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.

\[11]At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
\[12]Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.

\[19]My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
\[20]Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.
\[21]How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
\[22]For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are foolish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

\[26]I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.
\[27]For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.
\[28]For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
\[29]The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.
\[30]And when you are spoiled, what will you do? Though you cloth yourself with crimson, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you rent your face with painting, in vain shall you make yourself fair; your lovers will despise you, they will seek your life.
\[31]For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewails herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

un all of you back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if all of you can find a man, if there be any that executes judgment, that seeks the truth; and I will pardon it.
\[2]And though they say, The LORD lives; surely they swear falsely.
\[3]O LORD, are not yours eyes upon the truth? you have stricken them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
\[4]Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.
\[5]I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
\[6]Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.
\[7]How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.
\[8]They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.
\[9]Shall I not visit for these things? says the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]Go all of you up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.
\[11]For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, says the LORD.
\[12]They have lied concerning the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
\[13]And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
\[14]Wherefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, Because all of you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\[15]Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, says the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you know not, neither understand what they say.
\[16]Their quiver is as an open tomb, they are all mighty men.
\[17]And they shall eat up yours harvest, and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat: they shall eat up your flocks and yours herds: they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees: they shall impoverish your fenced cities, wherein you trusted, with the sword.
\[18]Nevertheless in those days, says the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.
\[19]And it shall come to pass, when all of you shall say, Wherefore does the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shall you answer them, Like all of you have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall all of you serve strangers in a land that is not your's.
\[20]Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\[21]Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:
\[22]Fear all of you not me? says the LORD: will all of you not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?
\[23]But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
\[24]Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that gives rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserves unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
\[25]Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good things from you.
\[26]For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that sets snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
\[27]As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and becoming rich.
\[28]They are becoming fat, they shine: yea, they pass over the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
\[29]Shall I not visit for these things? says the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[30]A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;
\[31]The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will all of you do in the end thereof?

 all of you children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appears out of the north, and great destruction.
\[2]I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
\[3]The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.
\[4]Prepare all of you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
\[5]Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
\[6]For thus has the LORD of hosts said, Hew all of you down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
\[7]As a fountain casts out her waters, so she casts out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.
\[8]Be you instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from you; lest I make you desolate, a land not inhabited.
\[9]Thus says the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back yours hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.
\[10]To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
\[11]Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.
\[12]And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, says the LORD.
\[13]For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely.
\[14]They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\[15]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, says the LORD.
\[16]Thus says the LORD, Stand all of you in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and all of you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.
\[17]Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
\[18]Therefore hear, all of you nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
\[19]Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.
\[20]To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.
\[21]Therefore thus says the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.
\[22]Thus says the LORD, Behold, a people comes from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.
\[23]They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against you, O daughter of Zion.
\[24]We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
\[25]Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.
\[26]O daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.
\[27]I have set you for a tower and a fortress among my people, that you may know and try their way.
\[28]They are all grievous apostates, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.
\[29]The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

\[2]Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.
\[3]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\[4]Trust all of you not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.
\[5]For if all of you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if all of you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;
\[6]If all of you oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:
\[7]Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.
\[8]Behold, all of you trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
\[9]Will all of you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom all of you know not;
\[10]And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?
\[11]Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, says the LORD.
\[12]But go all of you now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\[13]And now, because all of you have done all these works, says the LORD, and I spoke unto you, rising up early and speaking, but all of you heard not; and I called you, but all of you answered not;
\[14]Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein all of you trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
\[15]And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
\[16]Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear you.
\[17]See you not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[18]The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
\[19]Do they provoke me to anger? says the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
\[20]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\[21]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
\[22]For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
\[23]But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and all of you shall be my people: and walk all of you in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.
\[24]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\[25]Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
\[26]Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
\[27]Therefore you shall speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to you: you shall also call unto them; but they will not answer you.
\[28]But you shall say unto them, This is a nation that obeys not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receives correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\[29]Cut off yours hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
\[30]For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, says the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.
\[31]And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.
\[32]Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.
\[33]And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.
\[34]Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of delight, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

\[2]And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
\[3]And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places where I have driven them, says the LORD of hosts.
\[4]Moreover you shall say unto them, Thus says the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?
\[5]Why then is this people of Jerusalem slides back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
\[6]I hearkened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle.
\[7]Yea, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.
\[8]How do all of you say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.
\[9]The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?
\[10]Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely.
\[11]For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\[12]Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says the LORD.
\[13]I will surely consume them, says the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
\[14]Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
\[15]We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!
\[16]The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.
\[17]For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, says the LORD.
\[18]When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.
\[19]Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?
\[20]The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
\[21]For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment has taken hold on me.

\[2]Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of travelling men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
\[3]And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, says the LORD.
\[4]Take all of you heed every one of his neighbour, and trust all of you not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.
\[5]And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.
\[6]Yours habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, says the LORD.
\[7]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?
\[8]Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he lays his wait.
\[9]Shall I not visit them for these things? says the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\[10]For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
\[11]And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
\[12]Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perishes and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passes through?
\[13]And the LORD says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;
\[14]But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:
\[15]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
\[16]I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.
\[17]Thus says the LORD of hosts, Consider all of you, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:
\[18]And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
\[19]For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.
\[20]Yet hear the word of the LORD, O all of you women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.
\[21]For death has come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.
\[22]Speak, Thus says the LORD, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.
\[23]Thus says the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:
\[24]But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, says the LORD.
\[25]Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;
\[26]Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.

ear all of you the word which the LORD speaks unto you, O house of Israel:
\[2]Thus says the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
\[3]For the customs of the people are vain: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
\[4]They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
\[5]They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must essentially be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.
\[6]Forasmuch as there is none like unto you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is great in might.
\[7]Who would not fear you, O King of nations? in order to you does it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto you.
\[8]But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.
\[9]Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.
\[10]But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.
\[11]Thus shall all of you say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
\[12]He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.
\[13]When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.
\[14]Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[15]They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[16]The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.
\[17]Gather up your wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
\[18]For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.
\[19]Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.
\[20]My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone out of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\[21]For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
\[22]Behold, the noise of the bruit has come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.
\[23]O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walks to direct his steps.
\[24]O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in yours anger, lest you bring me to nothing.
\[25]Pour out your fury upon the heathen that know you not, and upon the families that call not on your name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

\[2]Hear all of you the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
\[3]And say you unto them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeys not the words of this covenant,
\[4]Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall all of you be my people, and I will be your God:
\[5]That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.
\[6]Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear all of you the words of this covenant, and do them.
\[7]For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
\[8]Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.
\[9]And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[10]They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.
\[12]Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\[13]For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have all of you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.
\[14]Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.
\[15]What has my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she has wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.
\[16]The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
\[17]For the LORD of hosts, that planted you, has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.
\[18]And the LORD has given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then you showed me their doings.
\[19]But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
\[20]But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for unto you have I revealed my cause.
\[21]Therefore thus says the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:
\[22]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:
\[23]And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

ighteous are you, O LORD, when I plead with you: yet let me talk with you of your judgments: Wherefore does the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?
\[2]You have planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
\[3]But you, O LORD, know me: you have seen me, and tried mine heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\[4]How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
\[5]If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein you trusted, they wearied you, then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan?
\[6]For even your brethren, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; yea, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto you.
\[7]I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
\[8]Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against me: therefore have I hated it.
\[9]Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come all of you, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.
\[10]Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
\[11]They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourns unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.
\[12]The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.
\[13]They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[14]Thus says the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
\[15]And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
\[16]And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.
\[17]But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, says the LORD.

hus says the LORD unto me, Go and get you a linen girdle, and put it upon your loins, and put it not in water.
\[2]So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.
\[3]And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
\[4]Take the girdle that you have got, which is upon your loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
\[5]So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
\[6]And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded you to hide there.
\[7]Then I went to Euphrates, and dug, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was ruined, it was profitable for nothing.
\[8]Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[9]Thus says the LORD, After this manner will I ruin the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\[10]This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
\[11]For as the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\[12]Therefore you shall speak unto them this word; Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto you, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\[13]Then shall you say unto them, Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\[14]And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.
\[15]Hear all of you, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD has spoken.
\[16]Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while all of you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
\[17]But if all of you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away captive.
\[18]Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.
\[19]The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.
\[20]Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
\[21]What will you say when he shall punish you? for you have taught them to be captains, and as chief over you: shall not sorrows take you, as a woman in travail?
\[22]And if you say in yours heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of yours iniquity are your skirts discovered, and your heels made bare.
\[23]Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may all of you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
\[24]Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.
\[25]This is your lot, the portion of your measures from me, says the LORD; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
\[26]Therefore will I discover your skirts upon your face, that your shame may appear.
\[27]I have seen yours adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your whoredom, and yours abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto you, O Jerusalem! will you not be made clean? when shall it once be?

he word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.
\[2]Judah mourns, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
\[3]And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
\[4]Because the ground is cracked, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
\[5]Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.
\[6]And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.
\[7]O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do you it for your name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.
\[8]O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why should you be as a stranger in the land, and as a travelling man that turns aside to tarry for a night?
\[9]Why should you be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; leave us not.
\[10]Thus says the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD does not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
\[11]Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.
\[12]When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\[13]Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, All of you shall not see the sword, neither shall all of you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
\[14]Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their heart.
\[15]Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\[16]And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
\[17]Therefore you shall say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
\[18]If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
\[19]Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
\[20]We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against you.
\[21]Do not detest us, for your name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, break not your covenant with us.
\[22]Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? are not you he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon you: for you have made all these things.

\[2]And it shall come to pass, if they say unto you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus says the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.
\[3]And I will appoint over them four kinds, says the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
\[4]And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
\[5]For who shall have pity upon you, O Jerusalem? or who shall lament for you? or who shall go aside to ask how you do?
\[6]You have forsaken me, says the LORD, you are gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against you, and destroy you; I am weary with repenting.
\[7]And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.
\[8]Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
\[9]She that has borne seven languishes: she has given up the spirit; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she has been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, says the LORD.
\[10]Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on interest, nor men have lent to me on interest; yet every one of them does curse me.
\[11]The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with your remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to plead you well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\[12]Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
\[13]Your substance and your treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.
\[14]And I will make you to pass with yours enemies into a land which you know not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
\[15]O LORD, you know: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in your longsuffering: know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.
\[16]Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.
\[17]I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand: for you have filled me with indignation.
\[18]Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?
\[19]Therefore thus says the LORD, If you return, then will I bring you again, and you shall stand before me: and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: let them return unto you; but return not you unto them.
\[20]And I will make you unto this people a fenced brazen wall: and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says the LORD.

\[2]You shall not take you a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters in this place.

\[4]They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
\[5]For thus says the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor lament for them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, says the LORD, even loving kindness and mercies.
\[6]Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
\[7]Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
\[8]You shall not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
\[9]For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of delight, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, when you shall show this people all these words, and they shall say unto you, Wherefore has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?
\[11]Then shall you say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, says the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
\[12]And all of you have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, all of you walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:
\[13]Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that all of you know not, neither all of you nor your fathers; and there shall all of you serve other gods day and night; where I will not show you favour.
\[14]Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[15]But, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.
\[16]Behold, I will send for many fishers, says the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
\[17]For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.
\[18]And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.
\[19]O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto you from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
\[20]Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

\[4]And you, even yourself, shall discontinue from yours heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve yours enemies in the land which you know not: for all of you have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.

\[22]Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do all of you any work, but hallow all of you the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
\[23]But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.
\[24]And it shall come to pass, if all of you diligently hearken unto me, says the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;

\[26]And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and food offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.
\[27]But if all of you will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

\[5]Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
\[6]O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? says the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are all of you in mine hand, O house of Israel.
\[7]At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;

\[14]Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which comes from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?
\[15]Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a road not properly built;
\[16]To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.
\[17]I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.

\[22]Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.

\[5]They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:

\[8]And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
\[9]And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and strictness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.

\[11]And shall say unto them, Thus says the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.

\[4]For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and yours eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
\[5]Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
\[6]And you, Pashur, and all that dwell in yours house shall go into captivity: and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and shall be buried there, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied lies.
\[7]O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.
\[8]For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.
\[9]Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.
\[10]For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Possibly he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
\[11]But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
\[12]But, O LORD of hosts, that try the righteous, and see the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for unto you have I opened my cause.
\[13]Sing unto the LORD, praise all of you the LORD: for he has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
\[14]Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
\[15]Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born unto you; making him very glad.
\[16]And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;
\[17]Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.
\[18]Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

he word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
\[2]Enquire, I pray you, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon makes war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
\[3]Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall all of you say to Zedekiah:
\[4]Thus says the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith all of you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.
\[5]And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
\[6]And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
\[7]And afterward, says the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
\[8]And unto this people you shall say, Thus says the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
\[9]He that abides in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
\[10]For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, says the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\[11]And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear all of you the word of the LORD;
\[12]O house of David, thus says the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\[13]Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, says the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
\[14]But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.

hus says the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
\[2]And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sit upon the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people that enter in by these gates:
\[3]Thus says the LORD; Execute all of you judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
\[4]For if all of you do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
\[5]But if all of you will not hear these words, I swear by myself, says the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.
\[6]For thus says the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; You are Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make you a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.
\[7]And I will prepare destroyers against you, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
\[8]And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore has the LORD done thus unto this great city?
\[9]Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
\[10]Weep all of you not for the dead, neither lament for him: but weep sore for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
\[11]For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:
\[12]But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
\[13]Woe unto him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbour's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;
\[14]That says, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cuts him out windows; and it is covered over with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\[15]Shall you reign, because you close yourself in cedar? did not your father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?
\[16]He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? says the LORD.
\[17]But yours eyes and yours heart are not but for your covetousness, and in order to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
\[18]Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
\[19]He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\[20]Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all your lovers are destroyed.
\[21]I spoke unto you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your manner from your youth, that you obeyed not my voice.
\[22]The wind shall eat up all your pastors, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.
\[23]O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how gracious shall you be when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman in travail!
\[24]As I live, says the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck you thence;
\[25]And I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]And I will cast you out, and your mother that bare you, into another country, where all of you were not born; and there shall all of you die.
\[27]But to the land unto which they desire to return, thither shall they not return.
\[28]Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
\[29]O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.
\[30]Thus says the LORD, Write all of you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.

oe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the LORD.
\[2]Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; All of you have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, says the LORD.
\[3]And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
\[4]And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, says the LORD.
\[5]Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
\[6]In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
\[7]Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\[8]But, The LORD lives, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries where I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
\[9]Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.
\[10]For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.
\[11]For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, says the LORD.
\[12]Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, says the LORD.
\[13]And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to go astray.
\[14]I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
\[15]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
\[16]Thus says the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD.
\[17]They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD has said, All of you shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walks after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.
\[18]For who has stood in the counsel of the LORD, and has perceived and heard his word? who has marked his word, and heard it?
\[19]Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.
\[20]The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days all of you shall consider it perfectly.
\[21]I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
\[22]But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
\[23]Am I a God at hand, says the LORD, and not a God far off?
\[24]Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? says the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? says the LORD.
\[25]I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\[26]How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;
\[27]Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.
\[28]The prophet that has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? says the LORD.
\[29]Is not my word like a fire? says the LORD; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
\[30]Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.
\[31]Behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He says.
\[32]Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, says the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to go astray by their lies, and by their levity; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, says the LORD.
\[33]And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? you shall then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, says the LORD.
\[34]And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.
\[35]Thus shall all of you say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What has the LORD answered? and, What has the LORD spoken?
\[36]And the burden of the LORD shall all of you mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for all of you have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.
\[37]Thus shall you say to the prophet, What has the LORD answered you? and, What has the LORD spoken?
\[38]But since all of you say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus says the LORD; Because all of you say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, All of you shall not say, The burden of the LORD;
\[39]Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:
\[40]And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

he LORD showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
\[2]One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
\[3]Then said the LORD unto me, What see you, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
\[4]Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[5]Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.
\[6]For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
\[7]And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
\[8]And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus says the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:
\[9]And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.
\[10]And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
\[2]The which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
\[3]From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD has come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but all of you have not hearkened.
\[4]And the LORD has sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but all of you have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
\[5]They said, Turn all of you again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD has given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:
\[6]And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
\[7]Yet all of you have not hearkened unto me, says the LORD; that all of you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
\[8]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts; Because all of you have not heard my words,
\[9]Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.
\[10]Moreover I will take from them the voice of delight, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
\[11]And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
\[12]And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, says the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.
\[13]And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
\[14]For many nations and great kings shall make use of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
\[15]For thus says the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.
\[16]And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
\[17]Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:
\[18]To know, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;
\[19]Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
\[20]And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
\[21]Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,
\[22]And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,
\[23]Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,
\[24]And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,
\[25]And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
\[26]And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
\[27]Therefore you shall say unto them, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink all of you, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
\[28]And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at yours hand to drink, then shall you say unto them, Thus says the LORD of hosts; All of you shall certainly drink.
\[29]For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should all of you be utterly unpunished? All of you shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says the LORD of hosts.
\[30]Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\[31]A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD has a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, says the LORD.
\[32]Thus says the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
\[33]And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.
\[34]Wail, all of you shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, all of you principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and all of you shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
\[35]And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
\[36]A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD has spoiled their pasture.
\[37]And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[38]He has forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

n the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Thus says the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's house, all the words that I command you to speak unto them; diminish not a word:
\[3]If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
\[4]And you shall say unto them, Thus says the LORD; If all of you will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
\[5]To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but all of you have not hearkened;
\[6]Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\[7]So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
\[8]Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, You shall surely die.
\[9]Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
\[10]When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.
\[11]Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city, as all of you have heard with your ears.
\[12]Then spoke Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that all of you have heard.
\[13]Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you.
\[14]As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seems good and meet unto you.
\[15]But know all of you for certain, that if all of you put me to death, all of you shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for truthfully the LORD has sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.
\[16]Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
\[17]Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
\[18]Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
\[19]Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
\[20]And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
\[21]And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
\[22]And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.
\[23]And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
\[24]Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

\[6]And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
\[7]And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make use of him.
\[8]And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, says the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
\[9]Therefore hearken not all of you to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, All of you shall not serve the king of Babylon:
\[10]For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and all of you should perish.
\[11]But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, says the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\[12]I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
\[13]Why will all of you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\[14]Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, All of you shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
\[15]For I have not sent them, says the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that all of you might perish, all of you, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
\[16]Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
\[17]Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?
\[18]But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
\[19]For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.
\[20]Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
\[21]Yea, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
\[22]They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, says the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.

nd it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spoke unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[3]Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:
\[4]And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, says the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\[5]Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,
\[6]Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
\[7]Nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in yours ears, and in the ears of all the people;
\[8]The prophets that have been before me and before you of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\[9]The prophet which prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD has truly sent him.
\[10]Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.
\[11]And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
\[12]Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says the LORD; You have broken the yokes of wood; but you shall make for them yokes of iron.
\[14]For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
\[15]Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD has not sent you; but you make this people to trust in a lie.
\[16]Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will cast you from off the face of the earth: this year you shall die, because you have taught rebellion against the LORD.
\[17]So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

ow these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
\[2](After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
\[3]By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
\[4]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;
\[5]Build all of you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
\[6]Take all of you wives, and brought forth sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that all of you may be increased there, and not diminished.
\[7]And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall all of you have peace.
\[8]For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which all of you cause to be dreamed.
\[9]For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, says the LORD.
\[10]For thus says the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
\[11]For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
\[12]Then shall all of you call upon me, and all of you shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
\[13]And all of you shall seek me, and find me, when all of you shall search for me with all your heart.
\[14]And I will be found of you, says the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
\[15]Because all of you have said, The LORD has raised us up prophets in Babylon;
\[16]Know that thus says the LORD of the king that sits upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwells in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
\[17]Thus says the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
\[18]And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them:
\[19]Because they have not hearkened to my words, says the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but all of you would not hear, says the LORD.
\[20]Hear all of you therefore the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\[21]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
\[22]And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
\[23]Because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, says the LORD.
\[24]Thus shall you also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
\[25]Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
\[26]The LORD has made you priest in the position of Jehoiada the priest, that all of you should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison, and in the stocks.
\[27]Now therefore why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which makes himself a prophet to you?
\[28]For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build all of you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[29]And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
\[30]Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,
\[31]Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah has prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:
\[32]Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, says the LORD; because he has taught rebellion against the LORD.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken unto you in a book.
\[3]For, lo, the days come, says the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
\[4]And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
\[5]For thus says the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
\[6]Ask all of you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
\[7]Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.
\[8]For it shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds, and strangers shall no more make use of him:
\[9]But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
\[10]Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, says the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save you from far, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
\[11]For I am with you, says the LORD, to save you: though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you, yet I will not make a full end of you: but I will correct you in measure, and will not leave you altogether unpunished.
\[12]For thus says the LORD, Your bruise is incurable, and your wound is grievous.
\[13]There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.
\[14]All your lovers have forgotten you; they seek you not; for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of yours iniquity; because your sins were increased.
\[15]Why cry you for yours affliction? your sorrow is incurable for the multitude of yours iniquity: because your sins were increased, I have done these things unto you.
\[16]Therefore all they that devour you shall be devoured; and all yours adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil you shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon you will I give for a prey.
\[17]For I will restore health unto you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says the LORD; because they called you an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeks after.
\[18]Thus says the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
\[19]And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
\[20]Their children also shall be as in old times, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
\[21]And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? says the LORD.
\[22]And all of you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[23]Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goes forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.
\[24]The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days all of you shall consider it.

t the same time, says the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
\[2]Thus says the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
\[3]The LORD has appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you.
\[4]Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel: you shall again be adorned with your timbrels, and shall go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
\[5]You shall yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.
\[6]For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise all of you, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.
\[7]For thus says the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish all of you, praise all of you, and say, O LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.
\[8]Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that labors with child together: a great company shall return thither.
\[9]They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
\[10]Hear the word of the LORD, O all of you nations, and declare it in the isles far off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.
\[11]For the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
\[12]Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
\[13]Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
\[14]And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says the LORD.
\[15]Thus says the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.
\[16]Thus says the LORD; Refrain your voice from weeping, and yours eyes from tears: for your work shall be rewarded, says the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
\[17]And there is hope in yours end, says the LORD, that your children shall come again to their own border.
\[18]I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock is not accustomed to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are the LORD my God.
\[19]Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I stroke upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
\[20]Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, says the LORD.
\[21]Set you up guideposts, make you high heaps: set yours heart toward the highway, even the way which you went: return, O virgin of Israel, return to these your cities.
\[22]How long will you go about, O you backsliding daughter? for the LORD has created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
\[23]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless you, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.
\[24]And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.
\[25]For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
\[26]Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
\[27]Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
\[28]And it shall come to pass, that like I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, says the LORD.
\[29]In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
\[30]But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eats the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\[31]Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
\[32]Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, says the LORD:
\[33]But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, says the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\[34]And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
\[35]Thus says the LORD, which gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divides the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:
\[36]If those ordinances depart from before me, says the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
\[37]Thus says the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says the LORD.
\[38]Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.
\[39]And the measuring line shall yet go forth opposite to it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
\[40]And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

he word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
\[2]For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.
\[3]For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore do you prophesy, and say, Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
\[4]And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
\[5]And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, says the LORD: though all of you fight with the Chaldeans, all of you shall not prosper.
\[6]And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[7]Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum yours uncle shall come unto you saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.
\[8]So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
\[9]And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
\[10]And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
\[11]So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:
\[12]And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
\[13]And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\[14]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
\[15]For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
\[16]Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,
\[17]Ah Lord GOD! behold, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for you:
\[18]You show loving kindness unto thousands, and recompence the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,
\[19]Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for yours eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
\[20]Which have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and have made you a name, as at this day;
\[21]And have brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;
\[22]And have given them this land, which you did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
\[23]And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commandedst them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them:
\[24]Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you have spoken has come to pass; and, behold, you see it.
\[25]And you have said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy you the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,
\[27]Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?
\[28]Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
\[29]And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
\[30]For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD.
\[31]For this city has been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
\[32]Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\[33]And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
\[34]But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
\[35]And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
\[36]And now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof all of you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\[37]Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
\[38]And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
\[39]And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
\[40]And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
\[41]Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\[42]For thus says the LORD; Like I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
\[43]And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof all of you say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\[44]Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, says the LORD.

\[6]Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
\[7]And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
\[8]And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
\[9]And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.
\[10]Thus says the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which all of you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,
\[11]The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, says the LORD.
\[12]Thus says the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
\[13]In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that tells them, says the LORD.
\[14]Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
\[15]In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
\[16]In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.
\[17]For thus says the LORD; David shall never lack a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
\[18]Neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle food offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
\[19]And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,
\[20]Thus says the LORD; If all of you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;
\[21]Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
\[22]As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
\[23]Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,
\[24]Consider you not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
\[25]Thus says the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
\[26]Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

he word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,
\[2]Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
\[3]And you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and yours eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.
\[4]Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus says the LORD of you, You shall not die by the sword:
\[5]But you shall die in peace: and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so shall they burn odours for you; and they will lament you, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, says the LORD.
\[6]Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
\[7]When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.
\[8]This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
\[9]That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to know, of a Jew his brother.
\[10]Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should make use of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.
\[11]But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
\[12]Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[13]Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,
\[14]At the end of seven years let all of you go every man his brother an Hebrew, which has been sold unto you; and when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
\[15]And all of you were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and all of you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\[16]But all of you turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
\[17]Therefore thus says the LORD; All of you have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, says the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
\[18]And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof,
\[19]The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;
\[20]I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
\[21]And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
\[22]Behold, I will command, says the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.

he word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
\[2]Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
\[3]Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
\[4]And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:
\[5]And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink all of you wine.
\[6]But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, All of you shall drink no wine, neither all of you, nor your sons for ever:
\[7]Neither shall all of you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days all of you shall dwell in tents; that all of you may live many days in the land where all of you be strangers.
\[8]Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
\[9]Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
\[10]But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\[11]But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.
\[12]Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,
\[13]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will all of you not receive instruction to hearken to my words? says the LORD.
\[14]The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but all of you hearkened not unto me.
\[15]I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return all of you now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and all of you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but all of you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
\[16]Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people has not hearkened unto me:
\[17]Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
\[18]And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because all of you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he has commanded you:
\[19]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before me for ever.

nd it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
\[2]Take you a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke unto you, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
\[3]It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
\[4]Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
\[5]And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:
\[6]Therefore go you, and read in the roll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
\[7]It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people.
\[8]And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
\[9]And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.
\[10]Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.
\[11]When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,
\[12]Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
\[13]Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
\[14]Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in yours hand the roll wherein you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
\[15]And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
\[16]Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and the other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
\[17]And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?
\[18]Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
\[19]Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where all of you be.
\[20]And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
\[21]So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
\[22]Now the king sat in the winter-house in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
\[23]And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
\[24]Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
\[25]Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
\[26]But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.
\[27]Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
\[28]Take you again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
\[29]And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus says the LORD; You have burned this roll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
\[30]Therefore thus says the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\[31]And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
\[32]Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.

nd king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
\[2]But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
\[3]And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.
\[4]Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
\[5]Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
\[6]Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,
\[7]Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall all of you say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
\[8]And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
\[9]Thus says the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.
\[10]For though all of you had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
\[11]And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
\[12]Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.
\[13]And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.
\[14]Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\[15]Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and stroke him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.
\[16]When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
\[17]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\[18]Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that all of you have put me in prison?
\[19]Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\[20]Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray you, be accepted before you; that you cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\[21]Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

hen Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,
\[2]Thus says the LORD, He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.
\[3]Thus says the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.
\[4]Therefore the princes said unto the king, We plead to you, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\[5]Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.
\[6]Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
\[7]Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;
\[8]Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king saying,
\[9]My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.
\[10]Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from behind thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
\[11]So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
\[12]And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under yours armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
\[13]So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\[14]Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.
\[15]Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, will you not hearken unto me?
\[16]So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD lives, that made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men that seek your life.
\[17]Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If you will assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and yours house:
\[18]But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.
\[19]And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
\[20]But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I plead to you, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto you: so it shall be well unto you, and your soul shall live.
\[21]But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD has showed me:
\[22]And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Your friends have set you on, and have prevailed against you: your feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.
\[23]So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans: and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.
\[24]Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.
\[25]But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come unto you, and say unto you, Declare unto us now what you have said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said unto you:
\[26]Then you shall say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
\[27]Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
\[28]So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

n the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
\[2]And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.
\[3]And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.
\[5]But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.
\[6]Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
\[7]Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
\[8]And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
\[9]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
\[10]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\[11]Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
\[12]Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto you.

\[16]Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before you.
\[17]But I will deliver you in that day, says the LORD: and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
\[18]For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey unto you: because you have put your trust in me, says the LORD.

\[2]And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD your God has pronounced this evil upon this place.

If it seem good unto you to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto you: but if it seem ill unto you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before you: where it seems good and convenient for you to go, thither go.
\[5]Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go where ever it seems convenient unto you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.
\[6]Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
\[7]Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
\[8]Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\[9]And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\[10]As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but all of you, gather all of you wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that all of you have taken.
\[11]Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;
\[12]Even all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
\[13]Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\[14]And said unto him, Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay you? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
\[15]Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray you, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay you, that all the Jews which are gathered unto you should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
\[16]But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing: for you speak falsely of Ishmael.

ow it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
\[2]Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and stroke Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\[3]Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.
\[4]And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
\[5]That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.
\[6]And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
\[7]And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.
\[8]But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he ceased, and slew them not among their brethren.
\[9]Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.
\[10]Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
\[11]But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
\[12]Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
\[13]Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.
\[14]So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
\[15]But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
\[16]Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:
\[17]And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
\[18]Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.

hen all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,
\[2]And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we plead to you, our supplication be accepted before you, and pray for us unto the LORD your God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as yours eyes do behold us:)
\[3]That the LORD your God may show us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.
\[4]Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.
\[5]Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD your God shall send you to us.
\[6]Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.
\[7]And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.
\[8]Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
\[9]And said unto them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom all of you sent me to present your supplication before him;
\[10]If all of you will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.
\[11]Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom all of you are afraid; be not afraid of him, says the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
\[12]And I will show mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
\[13]But if all of you say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,
\[14]Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
\[15]And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, all of you remnant of Judah; Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If all of you wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
\[16]Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which all of you feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof all of you were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there all of you shall die.
\[17]So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
\[18]For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury has been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when all of you shall enter into Egypt: and all of you shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and all of you shall see this place no more.
\[19]The LORD has said concerning you, O all of you remnant of Judah; Go all of you not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.
\[20]For all of you dissembled in your hearts, when all of you sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.
\[21]And now I have this day declared it to you; but all of you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he has sent me unto you.
\[22]Now therefore know certainly that all of you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where all of you desire to go and to sojourn.

nd it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,
\[2]Then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, You speak falsely: the LORD our God has not sent you to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:
\[3]But Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, in order to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.
\[4]So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.
\[5]But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;
\[6]Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
\[7]So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.
\[8]Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
\[9]Take great stones in yours hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
\[10]And say unto them, Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
\[11]And when he comes, he shall strike the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\[12]And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
\[13]He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.

he word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\[2]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; All of you have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwells therein,
\[3]Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, all of you, nor your fathers.
\[4]Nevertheless I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
\[5]But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
\[6]Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.
\[7]Therefore now thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit all of you this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and nursing infant, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;
\[8]In that all of you provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, where all of you be gone to dwell, that all of you might cut yourselves off, and that all of you might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\[9]Have all of you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\[10]They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
\[11]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
\[12]And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\[13]For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\[14]So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
\[15]Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
\[16]As for the word that you have spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto you.
\[17]But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
\[18]But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\[19]And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
\[20]Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,
\[21]The incense that all of you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, all of you, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?
\[22]So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which all of you have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
\[23]Because all of you have burned incense, and because all of you have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.
\[24]Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:
\[25]Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; All of you and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: all of you will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.
\[26]Therefore hear all of you the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD lives.
\[27]Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
\[28]Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.
\[29]And this shall be a sign unto you, says the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that all of you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
\[30]Thus says the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

\[2]Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon stroke in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
\[3]Order all of you the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
\[4]Harness the horses; and get up, all of you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; polish the spears, and put on the protective armor.
\[5]Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled swiftly, and look not back: for fear was round about, says the LORD.
\[6]Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
\[7]Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?
\[8]Egypt rises up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he says, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
\[9]Come up, all of you horses; and rage, all of you chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.
\[10]For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
\[11]Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.
\[12]The nations have heard of your shame, and your cry has filled the land: for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.
\[13]The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt.
\[14]Declare all of you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say all of you, Stand fast, and prepare you; for the sword shall devour round about you.
\[15]Why are your valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.
\[16]He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
\[17]They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed.
\[18]As I live, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he comes.
\[19]O you daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
\[20]Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction comes; it comes out of the north.
\[21]Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.
\[22]The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
\[23]They shall cut down her forest, says the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.
\[24]The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
\[25]The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, says; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:
\[26]And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says the LORD.
\[27]But fear not you, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save you from far off, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
\[28]Fear you not, O Jacob my servant, says the LORD: for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you: but I will not make a full end of you, but correct you in measure; yet will I not leave you wholly unpunished.

\[2]There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.
\[3]A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
\[4]Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\[5]For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
\[6]Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
\[7]For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.
\[8]And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.
\[9]Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.

\[11]Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his sediments of wine, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
\[12]Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.

\[21]And judgment has come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
\[22]And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,
\[23]And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

\[26]Make all of you him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
\[27]For was not Israel a derision unto you? was he found among thieves? for since you spoke of him, you skipped for joy.
\[28]O all of you that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.

\[30]I know his wrath, says the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.
\[31]Therefore will I wail for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
\[32]O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer: your plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon your summer fruits and upon your vintage.
\[33]And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.
\[34]From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
\[35]Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says the LORD, him that offers in the high places, and him that burns incense to his gods.
\[36]Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he has got are perished.
\[37]For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.
\[38]There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, says the LORD.
\[39]They shall wail, saying, How is it broken down! how has Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.
\[40]For thus says the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.
\[41]Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[42]And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against the LORD.
\[43]Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the LORD.
\[44]He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, says the LORD.
\[45]They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
\[46]Woe be unto you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perishes: for your sons are taken captives, and your daughters captives.
\[47]Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

oncerning the Ammonites, thus says the LORD; Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?
\[2]Therefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, says the LORD.
\[3]Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, all of you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run back and forth by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.
\[4]Wherefore glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?
\[5]Behold, I will bring a fear upon you, says the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about you; and all of you shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wanders.
\[6]And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, says the LORD.
\[7]Concerning Edom, thus says the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
\[8]Flee all of you, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.
\[9]If grape-gatherers come to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.
\[10]But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.
\[11]Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.
\[12]For thus says the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and are you he that shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink of it.
\[13]For I have sworn by myself, says the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
\[14]I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather all of you together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
\[15]For, lo, I will make you small among the heathen, and despised among men.
\[16]Your terribleness has deceived you, and the pride of yours heart, O you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from thence, says the LORD.
\[17]Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
\[18]As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, says the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.
\[19]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[20]Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
\[21]The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
\[22]Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
\[23]Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.
\[24]Damascus is waxed feeble, and turns herself to flee, and fear has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.
\[25]How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!
\[26]Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, says the LORD of hosts.
\[27]And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.
\[28]Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall strike, thus says the LORD; Arise all of you, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.
\[29]Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.
\[30]Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O all of you inhabitants of Hazor, says the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.
\[31]Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwells without care, says the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.
\[32]And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, says the LORD.
\[33]And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.
\[34]The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
\[35]Thus says the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
\[36]And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
\[37]For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, says the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:
\[38]And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, says the LORD.
\[39]But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, says the LORD.

he word that the LORD spoke against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
\[2]Declare all of you among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
\[3]For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
\[4]In those days, and in that time, says the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.
\[5]They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces in that direction, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.
\[6]My people has been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place.
\[7]All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
\[8]Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
\[9]For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
\[10]And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, says the LORD.
\[11]Because all of you were glad, because all of you rejoiced, O all of you destroyers of mine heritage, because all of you are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
\[12]Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\[13]Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
\[14]Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all you that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against the LORD.
\[15]Shout against her round about: she has given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she has done, do unto her.
\[16]Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
\[17]Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria has devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.
\[18]Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
\[19]And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
\[20]In those days, and in that time, says the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
\[21]Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, says the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded you.
\[22]A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
\[23]How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
\[24]I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, O Babylon, and you were not aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against the LORD.
\[25]The LORD has opened his armoury, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
\[26]Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
\[27]Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day has come, the time of their visitation.
\[28]The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
\[29]Call together the archers against Babylon: all you that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do unto her: for she has been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
\[30]Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, says the LORD.
\[31]Behold, I am against you, O you most proud, says the Lord GOD of hosts: for your day has come, the time that I will visit you.
\[32]And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
\[33]Thus says the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
\[34]Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and trouble the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[35]A sword is upon the Chaldeans, says the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
\[36]A sword is upon the liars; and they shall be foolish: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
\[37]A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
\[38]A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.
\[39]Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
\[40]As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, says the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
\[41]Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
\[42]They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not show mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against you, O daughter of Babylon.
\[43]The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
\[44]Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
\[45]Therefore hear all of you the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.
\[46]At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.

hus says the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;
\[2]And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
\[3]Against him that bends let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifts himself up in his brigandine: and spare all of you not her young men; destroy all of you utterly all her host.
\[4]Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.
\[5]For Israel has not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
\[6]Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.
\[7]Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.
\[8]Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
\[9]We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reachs unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
\[10]The LORD has brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.
\[11]Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.
\[12]Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD has both devised and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
\[13]O you that dwell upon many waters, abundant in treasures, yours end has come, and the measure of your covetousness.
\[14]The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout against you.
\[15]He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heaven by his understanding.
\[16]When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causes the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he makes lightnings with rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.
\[17]Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\[18]They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\[19]The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.
\[20]You are my battle axe and weapons of war: for with you will I break in pieces the nations, and with you will I destroy kingdoms;
\[21]And with you will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
\[22]With you also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with you will I break in pieces old and young; and with you will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
\[23]I will also break in pieces with you the shepherd and his flock; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke of oxen; and with you will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
\[24]And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, says the LORD.
\[25]Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, says the LORD, which destroys all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.
\[26]And they shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be desolate for ever, says the LORD.
\[27]Set all of you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.
\[28]Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.
\[29]And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.
\[30]The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might has failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwelling places; her bars are broken.
\[31]One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at every quarter,
\[32]And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
\[33]For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
\[34]Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a dragon, he has filled his belly with my delicates, he has cast me out.
\[35]The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
\[36]Therefore thus says the LORD; Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.
\[37]And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.
\[38]They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.
\[39]In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the LORD.
\[40]I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.
\[41]How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!
\[42]The sea has come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
\[43]Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwells, neither does any son of man pass thereby.
\[44]And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
\[45]My people, go all of you out of the midst of her, and deliver all of you every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.
\[46]And lest your heart faint, and all of you fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
\[47]Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
\[48]Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, says the LORD.
\[49]As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
\[50]All of you that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD far off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\[51]We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame has covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's house.
\[52]Wherefore, behold, the days come, says the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
\[53]Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, says the LORD.
\[54]A sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
\[55]Because the LORD has spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:
\[56]Because the spoiler has come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.
\[57]And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
\[58]Thus says the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.
\[59]The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.
\[60]So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.
\[61]And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, and shall see, and shall read all these words;
\[62]Then shall you say, O LORD, you have spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
\[63]And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:
\[64]And you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

edekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\[2]And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\[3]For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\[4]And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.
\[5]So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
\[6]And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\[7]Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.
\[8]But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
\[9]Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
\[10]And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
\[11]Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
\[12]Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
\[13]And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:
\[14]And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\[15]Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
\[16]But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
\[17]Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\[18]The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
\[19]And the basons, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.
\[20]The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\[21]And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fastener of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
\[22]And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capitals round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.
\[23]And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.
\[24]And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
\[25]He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
\[26]So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
\[27]And the king of Babylon stroke them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
\[28]This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:
\[29]In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
\[30]In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
\[31]And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.
\[32]And spoke kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
\[33]And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
\[34]And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

ow does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!
\[2]She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she has none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
\[3]Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwells among the heathen, she finds no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
\[4]The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
\[5]Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
\[6]And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
\[7]Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.
\[8]Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sighs, and turns backward.
\[9]Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembers not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself.
\[10]The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she has seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom you did command that they should not enter into your congregation.
\[11]All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for food to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.
\[12]Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.
\[13]From above has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate and faint all the day.
\[14]The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he has made my strength to fall, the LORD has delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.
\[15]The LORD has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he has called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD has trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
\[16]For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runs down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
\[17]Zion spreads forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD has commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
\[18]The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
\[19]I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the spirit in the city, while they sought their food to relieve their souls.
\[20]Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.
\[21]They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it: you will bring the day that you have called, and they shall be like unto me.
\[22]Let all their wickedness come before you; and do unto them, as you have done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

ow has the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
\[2]The LORD has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied: he has thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he has brought them down to the ground: he has polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
\[3]He has cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about.
\[4]He has bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
\[5]The LORD was as an enemy: he has swallowed up Israel, he has swallowed up all her palaces: he has destroyed his strong holds, and has increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
\[6]And he has violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he has destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD has caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
\[7]The LORD has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary, he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
\[8]The LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he has stretched out a line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
\[9]Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
\[10]The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
\[11]Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.
\[12]They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.
\[13]What thing shall I take to witness for you? what thing shall I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? for your breach is great like the sea: who can heal you?
\[14]Your prophets have seen vain and foolish things for you: and they have not discovered yours iniquity, to turn away your captivity; but have seen for you false burdens and causes of banishment.
\[15]All that pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and shake their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
\[16]All yours enemies have opened their mouth against you: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.
\[17]The LORD has done that which he had devised; he has fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he has thrown down, and has not pitied: and he has caused yours enemy to rejoice over you, he has set up the horn of yours adversaries.
\[18]Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give yourself no rest; let not the apple of yours eye cease.
\[19]Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out yours heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
\[20]Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom you have done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
\[21]The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; you have slain them in the day of yours anger; you have killed, and not pitied.
\[22]You have called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up has mine enemy consumed.

 AM the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
\[2]He has led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
\[3]Surely against me is he turned; he turns his hand against me all the day.
\[4]My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.
\[5]He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
\[6]He has set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.
\[7]He has hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he has made my chain heavy.
\[8]Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.
\[9]He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he has made my paths crooked.
\[10]He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.
\[11]He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he has made me desolate.
\[12]He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
\[13]He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
\[14]I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.
\[15]He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunken with wormwood.
\[16]He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he has covered me with ashes.
\[17]And you have removed my soul far off from peace: I forgotten about prosperity.
\[18]And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
\[19]Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
\[20]My soul has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
\[21]This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
\[22]It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
\[23]They are new every morning: great is your faithfulness.
\[24]The LORD is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
\[25]The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.
\[26]It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
\[27]It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.
\[28]He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it upon him.
\[29]He puts his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
\[30]He gives his cheek to him that strikes him: he is filled full with reproach.
\[31]For the LORD will not cast off for ever:
\[32]But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
\[33]For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
\[34]To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.
\[35]To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
\[36]To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approves not.
\[37]Who is he that says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord commands it not?
\[38]Out of the mouth of the most High proceeds not evil and good?
\[39]Wherefore does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
\[40]Let us search and try our ways, and return to the LORD.
\[41]Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
\[42]We have transgressed and have rebelled: you have not pardoned.
\[43]You have covered with anger, and persecuted us: you have slain, you have not pitied.
\[44]You have covered yourself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.
\[45]You have made us as the waste and refuse in the midst of the people.
\[46]All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
\[47]Fear and a snare has come upon us, desolation and destruction.
\[48]Mine eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\[49]Mine eye trickes down, and ceases not, without any intermission.
\[50]Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
\[51]Mine eye affects mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.
\[52]Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
\[53]They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
\[54]Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
\[55]I called upon your name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
\[56]You have heard my voice: hide not yours ear at my breathing, at my cry.
\[57]You drew near in the day that I called upon you: you said, Fear not.
\[58]O LORD, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.
\[59]O LORD, you have seen my wrong: judge you my cause.
\[60]You have seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
\[61]You have heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;
\[62]The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
\[63]Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their music.
\[64]Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
\[65]Give them sorrow of heart, your curse unto them.
\[66]Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.

\[2]The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
\[3]Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
\[4]The tongue of the nursing infant cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaks it unto them.
\[5]They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
\[6]For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
\[7]Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more rosy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:
\[8]Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaves to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
\[9]They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for lack of the fruits of the field.
\[10]The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
\[11]The LORD has accomplished his fury; he has poured out his fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured the foundations thereof.
\[12]The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
\[13]For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
\[14]They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
\[15]They cried unto them, Depart all of you; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.
\[16]The anger of the LORD has divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.
\[17]As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.
\[18]They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end has come.
\[19]Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
\[20]The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
\[21]Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto you: you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.
\[22]The punishment of yours iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry you away into captivity: he will visit yours iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover your sins.

\[12]Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.

\[17]For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.
\[18]Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.

ow it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\[2]In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
\[3]The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.
\[4]And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire setting itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
\[5]Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
\[6]And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
\[7]And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
\[8]And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
\[9]Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
\[10]As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
\[11]Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
\[12]And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.
\[13]As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\[14]And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\[15]Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
\[16]The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
\[17]When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.
\[18]As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.
\[19]And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
\[20]Anywhere the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up opposite to them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[21]When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up opposite to them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\[22]And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
\[23]And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
\[24]And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
\[25]And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.
\[26]And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
\[27]And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
\[28]As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.

\[3]And he said unto me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.
\[4]For they are shameless children and stiff hearted. I do send you unto them; and you shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD.
\[5]And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.

\[8]But you, son of man, hear what I say unto you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that I give you.

\[3]And he said unto me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this roll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
\[4]And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get you unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
\[5]For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;
\[6]Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have hearkened unto you.
\[7]But the house of Israel will not hearken unto you; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are shameless and hardhearted.
\[8]Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.
\[9]As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
\[10]Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto you receive in yours heart, and hear with yours ears.
\[11]And go, get you to them of the captivity, unto the children of your people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
\[12]Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.
\[13]I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels opposite to them, and a noise of a great rushing.
\[14]So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
\[15]Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
\[16]And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, I have made you a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
\[18]When I say unto the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at yours hand.
\[19]Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
\[20]Again, When a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at yours hand.
\[21]Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.
\[22]And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.
\[23]Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.
\[24]Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut yourself within yours house.
\[25]But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:
\[26]And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.
\[27]But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

\[5]For I have laid upon you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
\[6]And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.

\[13]And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.
\[14]Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
\[15]Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given you cow's dung for man's dung, and you shall prepare your bread therewith.

\[7]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because all of you multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;
\[8]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against you, and will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.
\[9]And I will do in you that which I have not done, and unto which I will not do any more the like, because of all yours abominations.
\[10]Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.
\[11]Wherefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD; Surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all yours abominations, therefore will I also diminish you; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.
\[12]A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
\[13]Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
\[14]Moreover I will make you waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all that pass by.
\[15]So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about you, when I shall execute judgments in you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.
\[16]When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:
\[17]So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you: and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword upon you. I the LORD have spoken it.

\[2]Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.
\[3]And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
\[4]And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.
\[5]Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up yours eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
\[6]He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.
\[7]And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.
\[8]Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold a door.
\[9]And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.
\[10]So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.
\[11]And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.
\[12]Then said he unto me, Son of man, have you seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD sees us not; the LORD has forsaken the earth.
\[13]He said also unto me, Turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations that they do.
\[14]Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
\[15]Then said he unto me, Have you seen this, O son of man? turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these.

\[22]Son of man, what is that proverb that all of you have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?
\[23]Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
\[24]For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
\[25]For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, says the Lord GOD.
\[26]Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.
\[27]Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of the times that are far off.
\[28]Therefore say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, says the Lord GOD.

nd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say you unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear all of you the word of the LORD;
\[3]Thus says the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
\[4]O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
\[5]All of you have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
\[6]They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD says: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.
\[7]Have all of you not seen a vain vision, and have all of you not spoken a lying divination, whereas all of you say, The LORD says it; although it be I have not spoken?
\[8]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because all of you have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, says the Lord GOD.
\[9]And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and all of you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[10]Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with plaster:
\[11]Say unto them which daub it with plaster, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and all of you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
\[12]Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith all of you have daubed it?
\[13]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.
\[14]So will I break down the wall that all of you have daubed with plaster, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and all of you shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[15]Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with plaster, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
\[16]To know, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says the Lord GOD.
\[17]Likewise, you son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy you against them,
\[18]And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will all of you hunt the souls of my people, and will all of you save the souls alive that come unto you?
\[19]And will all of you pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?
\[20]Wherefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith all of you there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that all of you hunt to make them fly.
\[21]Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[22]Because with lies all of you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:
\[23]Therefore all of you shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.

\[2]And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
\[4]Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols;
\[5]That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all cut off from me through their idols.
\[6]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
\[7]For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourns in Israel, which separates himself from me, and sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:
\[8]And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[9]And if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
\[10]And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeks unto him;
\[11]That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, says the Lord GOD.
\[12]The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
\[13]Son of man, when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
\[14]Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord GOD.
\[15]If I cause dangerous beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
\[16]Though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
\[17]Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
\[18]Though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
\[19]Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
\[20]Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
\[21]For thus says the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the dangerous beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
\[22]Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and all of you shall see their way and their doings: and all of you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
\[23]And they shall comfort you, when all of you see their ways and their doings: and all of you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord GOD.

\[4]Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?

gain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
\[3]And say, Thus says the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Your birth and your nativity is of the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite, and your mother an Hittite.
\[4]And as for your nativity, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to clean you; you were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
\[5]None eye pitied you, to do any of these unto you, to have compassion upon you; but you were cast out in the open field, to the loathing of your person, in the day that you were born.
\[6]And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in yours own blood, I said unto you when you were in your blood, Live; yea, I said unto you when you were in your blood, Live.
\[7]I have caused you to multiply as the bud of the field, and you have increased and becoming great, and you are come to excellent ornaments: your breasts are fashioned, and yours hair is grown, whereas you were naked and bare.
\[8]Now when I passed by you, and looked upon you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yea, I swore unto you, and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord GOD, and you became mine.
\[9]Then washed I you with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.
\[10]I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod you with badgers' skin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.
\[11]I decked you also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon your hands, and a chain on your neck.
\[12]And I put a jewel on your forehead, and earrings in yours ears, and a beautiful crown upon yours head.
\[13]Thus were you decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; you did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you were exceeding beautiful, and you did prosper into a kingdom.
\[14]And your renown went forth among the heathen for your beauty: for it was perfect through my loveliness, which I had put upon you, says the Lord GOD.
\[15]But you did trust in yours own beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and poured out your fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
\[16]And of your garments you did take, and decked your high places with divers colours, and played the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.
\[17]You have also taken your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made to yourself images of men, and did commit whoredom with them,
\[18]And took your broidered garments, and covered them: and you have set mine oil and mine incense before them.
\[19]My food also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed you, you have even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, says the Lord GOD.
\[20]Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne unto me, and these have you sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of your whoredoms a small matter,
\[21]That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?
\[22]And in all yours abominations and your whoredoms you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were polluted in your blood.
\[23]And it came to pass after all your wickedness, (woe, woe unto you! says the LORD GOD;)
\[24]That you have also built unto you an eminent place, and have made you an high place in every street.
\[25]You have built your high place at every head of the way, and have made your beauty to be abhorred, and have opened your feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied your whoredoms.
\[26]You have also committed fornication with the Egyptians your neighbours, great of flesh; and have increased your whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
\[27]Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished yours ordinary food, and delivered you unto the will of them that hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of your lewd way.
\[28]You have played the whore also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yea, you have played the harlot with them, and yet could not be satisfied.
\[29]You have moreover multiplied your fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied therewith.
\[30]How weak is yours heart, says the LORD GOD, seeing you do all these things, the work of an domineering whorish woman;
\[31]In that you build yours eminent place in the head of every way, and make yours high place in every street; and have not been as an harlot, in that you scorn hire;
\[32]But as a wife that commits adultery, which takes strangers instead of her husband!
\[33]They give gifts to all whores: but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and hire them, that they may come unto you on every side for your whoredom.
\[34]And the contrary is in you from other women in your whoredoms, whereas none follows you to commit whoredoms: and in that you give a reward, and no reward is given unto you, therefore you are contrary.
\[35]Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:
\[36]Thus says the Lord GOD; Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness discovered through your whoredoms with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your children, which you did give unto them;
\[37]Behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all them that you have loved, with all them that you have hated; I will even gather them round about against you, and will discover your nakedness unto them, that they may see all your nakedness.
\[38]And I will judge you, as women that violate marriage bond and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.
\[39]And I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down yours eminent place, and shall break down your high places: they shall strip you also of your clothes, and shall take your fair jewels, and leave you naked and bare.
\[40]They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.
\[41]And they shall burn yours houses with fire, and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women: and I will cause you to cease from playing the harlot, and you also shall give no hire any more.
\[42]So will I make my fury toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
\[43]Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense your way upon yours head, says the Lord GOD: and you shall not commit this lewdness above all yours abominations.
\[44]Behold, every one that uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
\[45]You are your mother's daughter, that detests her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, which loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\[46]And yours elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
\[47]Yet have you not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, you were corrupted more than they in all your ways.
\[48]As I live, says the Lord GOD, Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.
\[49]Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\[50]And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.
\[51]Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied yours abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all yours abominations which you have done.
\[52]You also, which have judged your sisters, bear yours own shame for your sins that you have committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than you: yea, be you confounded also, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.
\[53]When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of your captives in the midst of them:
\[54]That you may bear yours own shame, and may be confounded in all that you have done, in that you are a comfort unto them.
\[55]When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.
\[56]For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,
\[57]Before your wickedness was discovered, as at the time of your reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise you round about.
\[58]You have borne your lewdness and yours abominations, says the LORD.
\[59]For thus says the Lord GOD; I will even deal with you as you have done, which have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
\[60]Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish unto you an everlasting covenant.
\[61]Then you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, yours elder and your younger: and I will give them unto you for daughters, but not by your covenant.
\[62]And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the LORD:
\[63]That you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more because of your shame, when I am pacified toward you for all that you have done, says the Lord GOD.

nd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;
\[3]And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:
\[4]He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of trade; he set it in a city of merchants.
\[5]He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.
\[6]And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
\[7]There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
\[8]It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
\[9]Say you, Thus says the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
\[10]Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
\[11]Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[12]Say now to the rebellious house, Know all of you not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem, and has taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;
\[13]And has taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:
\[14]That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.
\[15]But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?
\[16]As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
\[17]Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:
\[18]Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and has done all these things, he shall not escape.
\[19]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.
\[20]And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.
\[21]And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and all of you shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.
\[22]Thus says the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:
\[23]In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
\[24]And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.

\[2]What mean all of you, that all of you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?
\[3]As I live, says the Lord GOD, all of you shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.
\[4]Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.
\[5]But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
\[6]And has not eaten upon the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbour's wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,
\[7]And has not oppressed any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has spoiled none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;
\[8]He that has not given forth upon interest, neither has taken any increase, that has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true judgment between man and man,
\[9]Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord GOD.
\[10]If he brought forth a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like to any one of these things,
\[11]And that does not any of those duties, but even has eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,
\[12]Has oppressed the poor and needy, has spoiled by violence, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,
\[13]Has given forth upon interest, and has taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
\[14]Now, lo, if he brought forth a son, that sees all his father's sins which he has done, and considers, and does not such like,
\[15]That has not eaten upon the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighbour's wife,
\[16]Neither has oppressed any, has not withheld the pledge, neither has spoiled by violence, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment,
\[17]That has taken off his hand from the poor, that has not received interest nor increase, has executed my judgments, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
\[18]As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
\[19]Yet say all of you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.
\[20]The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
\[21]But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[22]All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live.
\[23]Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? says the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?
\[24]But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die.
\[25]Yet all of you say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
\[26]When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done shall he die.
\[27]Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
\[28]Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[29]Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
\[30]Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
\[31]Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby all of you have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will all of you die, O house of Israel?
\[32]For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live all of you.

\[11]And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.
\[12]But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
\[13]And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.
\[14]And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

nd it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
\[2]Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
\[3]Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Are all of you come to enquire of me? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
\[4]Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
\[5]And say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;
\[6]In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:
\[7]Then said I unto them, Cast all of you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
\[8]But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
\[9]But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
\[10]Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
\[11]And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.
\[12]Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.
\[13]But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
\[14]But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
\[15]Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
\[16]Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
\[17]Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
\[18]But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk all of you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
\[19]I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
\[20]And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that all of you may know that I am the LORD your God.
\[21]Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
\[22]Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
\[23]I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
\[24]Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.
\[25]Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
\[26]And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.
\[27]Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\[28]For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.
\[29]Then I said unto them, What is the high place unto which all of you go? And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.
\[30]Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Are all of you polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit all of you whoredom after their abominations?
\[31]For when all of you offer your gifts, when all of you make your sons to pass through the fire, all of you pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
\[32]And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that all of you say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
\[33]As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
\[34]And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein all of you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
\[35]And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
\[36]Like I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, says the Lord GOD.
\[37]And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
\[38]And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[39]As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD; Go all of you, serve all of you every one his idols, and hereafter also, if all of you will not hearken unto me: but pollute all of you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
\[40]For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
\[41]I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein all of you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
\[42]And all of you shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.
\[43]And there shall all of you remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein all of you have been defiled; and all of you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that all of you have committed.
\[44]And all of you shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O all of you house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.
\[45]Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[46]Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
\[47]And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
\[48]And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
\[49]Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?

nd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop your word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
\[3]And say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD; Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.
\[4]Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
\[5]That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.
\[6]Sigh therefore, you son of man, with the breaking of your loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
\[7]And it shall be, when they say unto you, Wherefore sigh you? that you shall answer, For the tidings; because it comes: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and shall be brought to pass, says the Lord GOD.
\[8]Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[9]Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
\[10]It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make delight? it despises the rod of my son, as every tree.
\[11]And he has given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
\[12]Cry and wail, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: strike therefore upon your thigh.
\[13]Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, says the Lord GOD.
\[14]You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike yours hands together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which enters into their privy chambers.
\[15]I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.
\[16]Go you one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, anywhere your face is set.
\[17]I will also strike mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.
\[18]The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,
\[19]Also, you son of man, appoint you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both two shall come forth out of one land: and choose you a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
\[20]Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
\[21]For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
\[22]At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.
\[23]And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
\[24]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because all of you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that all of you are come to remembrance, all of you shall be taken with the hand.
\[25]And you, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, when iniquity shall have an end,
\[26]Thus says the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and bring low him that is high.
\[27]I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it him.
\[28]And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say you, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:
\[29]While they see vanity unto you, while they divine a lie unto you, to bring you upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day has come, when their iniquity shall have an end.
\[30]Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your nativity.
\[31]And I will pour out mine indignation upon you, I will blow against you in the fire of my wrath, and deliver you into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.
\[32]You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.

oreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[2]Now, you son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? yea, you shall show her all her abominations.
\[3]Then say you, Thus says the Lord GOD, The city sheds blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and makes idols against herself to defile herself.
\[4]You are become guilty in your blood that you have shed; and have defiled yourself in yours idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near, and are come even unto your years: therefore have I made you a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
\[5]Those that be near, and those that be far from you, shall mock you, which are ill repute and much vexed.
\[6]Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in you to their power to shed blood.
\[7]In you have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
\[8]You have despised mine holy things, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\[9]In you are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in you they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of you they commit lewdness.
\[10]In you have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in you have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
\[11]And one has committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
\[12]In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbours by extortion, and have forgotten me, says the Lord GOD.
\[13]Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in the midst of you.
\[14]Can yours heart endure, or can yours hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.
\[15]And I will scatter you among the heathen, and disperse you in the countries, and will consume your filthiness out of you.
\[16]And you shall take yours inheritance in yourself in the sight of the heathen, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[17]And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.
\[19]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because all of you are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
\[20]As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
\[21]Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and all of you shall be melted in the midst thereof.
\[22]As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall all of you be melted in the midst thereof; and all of you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
\[23]And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, say unto her, You are the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
\[25]There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
\[26]Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
\[27]Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
\[28]And her prophets have daubed them with plaster, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus says the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.
\[29]The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
\[30]And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
\[31]Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, says the Lord GOD.

he word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
\[3]And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
\[4]And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
\[5]And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,
\[6]Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
\[7]Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
\[8]Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
\[9]Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
\[10]These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
\[11]And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.
\[12]She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
\[13]Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
\[14]And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
\[15]Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
\[16]And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
\[17]And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
\[18]So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like my mind was alienated from her sister.
\[19]Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
\[20]For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
\[21]Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, in bruising your teats by the Egyptians for the breast of your youth.
\[22]Therefore, O Aholibah, thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your mind is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side;
\[23]The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
\[24]And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against you buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.
\[25]And I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you: they shall take away your nose and yours ears; and your remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured by the fire.
\[26]They shall also strip you out of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels.
\[27]Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that you shall not lift up yours eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
\[28]For thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your mind is alienated:
\[29]And they shall deal with you hatefully, and shall take away all your labour, and shall leave you naked and bare: and the nakedness of your whoredoms shall be discovered, both your lewdness and your whoredoms.
\[30]I will do these things unto you, because you have gone a whoring after the heathen, and because you are polluted with their idols.
\[31]You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into yours hand.
\[32]Thus says the Lord GOD; You shall drink of your sister's cup deep and large: you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.
\[33]You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.
\[34]You shall even drink it and suck it out, and you shall break the earthen ware thereof, and pluck off yours own breasts: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.
\[35]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your whoredoms.
\[36]The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, will you judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;
\[37]That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.
\[38]Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
\[39]For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
\[40]And furthermore, that all of you have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom you did wash yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,
\[41]And sat upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon you have set mine incense and mine oil.
\[42]And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
\[43]Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?
\[44]Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that plays the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
\[45]And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
\[46]For thus says the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
\[47]And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
\[48]Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
\[49]And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and all of you shall bear the sins of your idols: and all of you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

gain in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, write you the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
\[3]And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:
\[4]Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
\[5]Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
\[6]Wherefore thus says the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
\[7]For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
\[8]That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
\[9]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
\[10]Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
\[11]Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
\[12]She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.
\[13]In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon you.
\[14]I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, says the Lord GOD.
\[15]Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[16]Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of yours eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.
\[17]Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the head decoration of yours head upon you, and put on your shoes upon your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.
\[18]So I spoke unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\[19]And the people said unto me, Will you not tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?
\[20]Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[21]Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom all of you have left shall fall by the sword.
\[22]And all of you shall do as I have done: all of you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
\[23]And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: all of you shall not mourn nor weep; but all of you shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.
\[24]Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he has done shall all of you do: and when this comes, all of you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[25]Also, you son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
\[26]That he that escapes in that day shall come unto you, to cause you to hear it with yours ears?
\[27]In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

\[2]Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
\[3]And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus says the Lord GOD; Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;
\[4]Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
\[5]And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[6]For thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have clapped yours hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your despite against the land of Israel;
\[7]Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon you, and will deliver you for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut you off from the people, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[8]Thus says the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;
\[9]Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,
\[10]Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
\[11]And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[12]Thus says the Lord GOD; Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
\[13]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
\[14]And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord GOD.
\[15]Thus says the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;
\[16]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
\[17]And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

\[2]Son of man, because that Tyrus has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:
\[3]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes his waves to come up.
\[4]And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.
\[5]It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.
\[6]And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[7]For thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.
\[8]He shall slay with the sword your daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against you, and cast a mount against you, and lift up the buckler against you.
\[9]And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.
\[10]By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you: your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
\[11]With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets: he shall slay your people by the sword, and your strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
\[12]And they shall make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise: and they shall break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses: and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the water.
\[13]And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard.
\[14]And I will make you like the top of a rock: you shall be a place to spread nets upon; you shall be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.
\[15]Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of you?
\[16]Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at you.
\[17]And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, How are you destroyed, that were inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which were strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!
\[18]Now shall the isles tremble in the day of your fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at your departure.
\[19]For thus says the Lord GOD; When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon you, and great waters shall cover you;
\[20]When I shall bring you down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set you in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;

\[4]Your borders are in the midst of the seas, your builders have perfected your beauty.
\[5]They have made all your ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for you.
\[6]Of the oaks of Bashan have they made yours oars; the company of the Ashurites have made your benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.
\[7]Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered you.
\[8]The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were your seamen: your wise men, O Tyrus, that were in you, were your pilots.
\[9]The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your repairer of breaches: all the ships of the sea with their seamen were in you to occupy your merchandise.
\[10]They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in yours army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your loveliness.
\[11]The men of Arvad with yours army were upon your walls round about, and the Gammadims  were in your towers: they hanged their shields upon your walls round about; they have made your beauty perfect.

\[14]They of the house of Togarmah traded in your fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
\[15]The men of Dedan were your merchants; many isles were the merchandise of yours hand: they brought you for a present horns of ivory and ebony.
\[16]Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making: they occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.
\[17]Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants: they traded in your market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
\[18]Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

\[20]Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
\[21]Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they your merchants.
\[22]The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.
\[23]Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.
\[24]These were your merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among your merchandise.
\[25]The ships of Tarshish did sing of you in your market: and you were replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.
\[26]Your rowers have brought you into great waters: the east wind has broken you in the midst of the seas.
\[27]Your riches, and your fairs, your merchandise, your seamen, and your pilots, your repairer of breaches, and the occupiers of your merchandise, and all your men of war, that are in you, and in all your company which is in the midst of you, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of your ruin.

\[29]And all that handle the oar, the seamen, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;
\[30]And shall cause their voice to be heard against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
\[31]And they shall make themselves utterly bald for you, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for you with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.
\[32]And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you, and lament over you, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?
\[33]When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many people; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.
\[34]In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the midst of you shall fall.
\[35]All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at you, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.

\[3]Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from you:
\[4]With your wisdom and with yours understanding you have got you riches, and have got gold and silver into your treasures:
\[5]By your great wisdom and by your trade have you increased your riches, and yours heart is lifted up because of your riches:
\[6]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have set yours heart as the heart of God;
\[7]Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon you, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they shall defile your brightness.
\[8]They shall bring you down to the pit, and you shall die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.
\[9]Will you yet say before him that slays you, I am God? but you shall be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slays you.
\[10]You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.
\[11]Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[12]Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus says the Lord GOD; You seal up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
\[13]You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the ruby, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your timbrels and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.
\[14]You are the anointed cherub that covers; and I have set you so: you were upon the holy mountain of God; you have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
\[15]You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, till iniquity was found in you.
\[16]By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the midst of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
\[17]Yours heart was lifted up because of your beauty, you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness: I will cast you to the ground, I will lay you before kings, that they may behold you.
\[18]You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of yours iniquities, by the iniquity of your trade; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of you, it shall devour you, and I will bring you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold you.
\[19]All they that know you among the people shall be astonished at you: you shall be a terror, and never shall you be any more.
\[20]Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[21]Son of man, set your face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,
\[22]And say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of you: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
\[23]For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[24]And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[25]Thus says the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.
\[26]And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.

\[4]But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick unto your scales, and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick unto your scales.
\[5]And I will leave you thrown into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers: you shall fall upon the open fields; you shall not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given you for food to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
\[6]And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
\[7]When they took hold of you by your hand, you did break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon you, you brake, and made all their loins to be at a stand.
\[8]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and cut off man and beast out of you.
\[9]And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he has said, The river is mine, and I have made it.
\[10]Behold, therefore I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
\[11]No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
\[12]And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\[13]Yet thus says the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people where they were scattered:
\[14]And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
\[15]It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
\[16]And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which brings their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
\[17]And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[18]Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:
\[19]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
\[20]I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, says the Lord GOD.

\[4]And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
\[5]Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.

\[2]Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom are you like in your greatness?
\[3]Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.
\[4]The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.
\[5]Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.
\[6]All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.
\[7]Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.
\[8]The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
\[9]I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
\[10]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Because you have lifted up yourself in height, and he has shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
\[11]I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
\[12]And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
\[13]Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
\[14]To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
\[15]Thus says the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\[16]I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
\[17]They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.
\[18]To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shall you be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD.

\[23]Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.
\[24]There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
\[25]They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.
\[26]There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
\[27]And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
\[28]Yea, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shall lie with them that are slain with the sword.
\[29]There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.
\[30]There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.
\[31]Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, says the Lord GOD.
\[32]For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD.

gain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[2]Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:
\[3]If when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
\[4]Then whosoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
\[5]He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that takes warning shall deliver his soul.
\[6]But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
\[7]So you, O son of man, I have set you a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.
\[8]When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die; if you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at yours hand.
\[9]Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
\[10]Therefore, O you son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus all of you speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?
\[11]Say unto them, As I live, says the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn all of you, turn all of you from your evil ways; for why will all of you die, O house of Israel?
\[12]Therefore, you son of man, say unto the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sins.
\[13]When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he has committed, he shall die for it.
\[14]Again, when I say unto the wicked, You shall surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
\[15]If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
\[16]None of his sins that he has committed shall be mentioned unto him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
\[17]Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
\[18]When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall even die thereby.
\[19]But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
\[20]Yet all of you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O all of you house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
\[21]And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
\[22]Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
\[23]Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[24]Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
\[25]Wherefore say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; All of you eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall all of you possess the land?
\[26]All of you stand upon your sword, all of you work abomination, and all of you defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall all of you possess the land?
\[27]Say you thus unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
\[28]For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.
\[29]Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.
\[30]Also, you son of man, the children of your people still are talking against you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the LORD.
\[31]And they come unto you as the people comes, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their covetousness.
\[32]And, lo, you are unto them as a very lovely song of one that has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear your words, but they do them not.
\[33]And when this comes to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet has been among them.

\[2]Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
\[3]All of you eat the fat, and all of you clothe you with the wool, all of you kill them that are fed: but all of you feed not the flock.
\[4]The diseased have all of you not strengthened, neither have all of you healed that which was sick, neither have all of you bound up that which was broken, neither have all of you brought again that which was driven away, neither have all of you sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have all of you ruled them.
\[5]And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became food to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.
\[6]My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.
\[7]Therefore, all of you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
\[8]As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;
\[9]Therefore, O all of you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;
\[10]Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
\[11]For thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.
\[12]As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\[13]And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
\[14]I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
\[15]I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord GOD.
\[16]I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
\[17]And as for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.
\[18]Seems it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but all of you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but all of you must foul the residue with your feet?
\[19]And as for my flock, they eat that which all of you have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which all of you have fouled with your feet.
\[20]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.
\[21]Because all of you have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till all of you have scattered them abroad;
\[22]Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
\[23]And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
\[24]And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.
\[25]And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
\[26]And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
\[27]And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.
\[28]And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.
\[29]And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.
\[30]Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord GOD.
\[31]And all of you my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, says the Lord GOD.

\[4]I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[5]Because you have had a perpetual hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:
\[6]Therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will prepare you unto blood, and blood shall pursue you: since you have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you.
\[7]Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passes out and him that returns.
\[8]And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in your hills, and in your valleys, and in all your rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.

\[2]Thus says the Lord GOD; Because the enemy has said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:
\[3]Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that all of you might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and all of you are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an ill repute of the people:
\[4]Therefore, all of you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about;
\[5]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.
\[6]Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because all of you have borne the shame of the heathen:
\[7]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.
\[8]But all of you, O mountains of Israel, all of you shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.
\[9]For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and all of you shall be tilled and sown:
\[10]And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be built:
\[11]And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and all of you shall know that I am the LORD.
\[12]Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no more henceforth bereave them of men.
\[13]Thus says the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, You land devour up men, and have bereaved your nations:
\[14]Therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nations any more, says the Lord GOD.
\[15]Neither will I cause men to hear in you the shame of the heathen any more, neither shall you bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shall you cause your nations to fall any more, says the Lord GOD.
\[16]Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
\[17]Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.
\[18]Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:
\[19]And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
\[20]And when they entered unto the heathen, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.
\[21]But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, where they went.
\[22]Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which all of you have profaned among the heathen, where all of you went.
\[23]And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which all of you have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
\[24]For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.
\[25]Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and all of you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
\[26]A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.
\[27]And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and all of you shall keep my judgments, and do them.
\[28]And all of you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and all of you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\[29]I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.
\[30]And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that all of you shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.
\[31]Then shall all of you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
\[32]Not for your sakes do I this, says the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.
\[33]Thus says the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.
\[34]And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.
\[35]And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.
\[36]Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.
\[37]Thus says the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.
\[38]As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

he hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,
\[2]And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
\[3]And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, you know.
\[4]Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O all of you dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

\[11]Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.
\[12]Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
\[13]And all of you shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

\[17]And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in yours hand.
\[18]And when the children of your people shall speak unto you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?
\[19]Say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.
\[20]And the sticks whereon you write shall be in yours hand before their eyes.
\[21]And say unto them, Thus says the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, where they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
\[22]And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.
\[23]Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
\[24]And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.
\[25]And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.
\[26]Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
\[27]My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

\[18]And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face.

\[2]And I will turn you back, and leave but the sixth part of you, and will cause you to come up from the north parts, and will bring you upon the mountains of Israel:
\[3]And I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause yours arrows to fall out of your right hand.
\[4]You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you, and all your bands, and the people that is with you: I will give you unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
\[5]You shall fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, says the Lord GOD.
\[6]And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
\[7]So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
\[8]Behold, it has come, and it is done, says the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
\[9]And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staffs, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:
\[10]So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, says the Lord GOD.
\[11]And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.
\[12]And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.
\[13]Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, says the Lord GOD.
\[14]And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
\[15]And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.
\[16]And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
\[17]And, you son of man, thus says the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that all of you may eat flesh, and drink blood.
\[18]All of you shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
\[19]And all of you shall eat fat till all of you be full, and drink blood till all of you be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
\[20]Thus all of you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the Lord GOD.
\[21]And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
\[22]So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.
\[23]And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.
\[24]According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.
\[25]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;
\[26]After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.
\[27]When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;
\[28]Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.
\[29]Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord GOD.

n the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the very same day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.
\[2]In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.
\[3]And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
\[4]And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with yours eyes, and hear with yours ears, and set yours heart upon all that I shall show you; in order to the intent that I might show them unto you are you brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.
\[5]And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
\[6]Then came he unto the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.
\[7]And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
\[8]He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
\[9]Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.
\[10]And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
\[11]And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
\[12]The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
\[13]He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.
\[14]He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.
\[15]And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
\[16]And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.
\[17]Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
\[18]And the pavement by the side of the gates opposite to the length of the gates was the lower pavement.
\[19]Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.
\[20]And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.
\[21]And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[22]And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
\[23]And the gate of the inner court was opposite to the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.
\[24]After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
\[25]And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[26]And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
\[27]And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.
\[28]And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
\[29]And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\[30]And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
\[31]And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\[32]And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.
\[33]And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\[34]And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\[35]And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures;
\[36]The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\[37]And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
\[38]And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.
\[39]And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
\[40]And at the side without, as one goes up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.
\[41]Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.
\[42]And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
\[43]And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.
\[44]And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
\[45]And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
\[46]And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.
\[47]So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.
\[48]And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\[49]The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

fterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
\[2]And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.
\[3]Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
\[4]So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
\[5]After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
\[6]And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.
\[7]And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the low chamber to the highest by the midst.
\[8]I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
\[9]The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.
\[10]And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
\[11]And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
\[12]Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.
\[13]So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;
\[14]Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.
\[15]And he measured the length of the building opposite to the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
\[16]The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, opposite to the door, covered over with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;
\[17]To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
\[18]And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;
\[19]So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.
\[20]From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.
\[21]The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.
\[22]The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.
\[23]And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
\[24]And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.
\[25]And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.
\[26]And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

hen he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was opposite to the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.
\[2]Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
\[3]Opposite to the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and opposite to the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
\[4]And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
\[5]Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.
\[6]For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the low and the middlemost from the ground.
\[7]And the wall that was without opposite to the chambers, toward the utter court on the front part of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
\[8]For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.
\[9]And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the utter court.
\[10]The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite to the separate place, and opposite to the building.
\[11]And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their activities out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\[12]And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.
\[13]Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the food offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
\[14]When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.
\[15]Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.
\[16]He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\[17]He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\[18]He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
\[19]He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\[20]He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

\[2]And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.
\[3]And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
\[4]And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.
\[5]So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.
\[6]And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
\[7]And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places.
\[8]In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
\[9]Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
\[10]You son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.
\[11]And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the activities out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
\[12]This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
\[13]And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.
\[14]And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.
\[15]So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.
\[16]And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.
\[17]And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.
\[18]And he said unto me, Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
\[19]And you shall give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, says the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.
\[20]And you shall take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shall you cleanse and purge it.
\[21]You shall take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
\[22]And on the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
\[23]When you have made an end of cleansing it, you shall offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
\[24]And you shall offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
\[25]Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
\[26]Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.
\[27]And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord GOD.

\[2]Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.
\[3]It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
\[4]Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.
\[5]And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with yours eyes, and hear with yours ears all that I say unto you concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going out of the sanctuary.
\[6]And you shall say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD; O all of you house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,
\[7]In that all of you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when all of you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
\[8]And all of you have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but all of you have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\[9]Thus says the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.
\[10]And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.
\[11]Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
\[12]Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, says the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.
\[13]And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\[14]But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
\[15]But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, says the Lord GOD:
\[16]They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
\[17]And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
\[18]They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causes sweat.
\[19]And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
\[20]Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.
\[21]Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
\[22]Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
\[23]And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
\[24]And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
\[25]And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that has had no husband, they may defile themselves.
\[26]And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
\[27]And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord GOD.
\[28]And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and all of you shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.
\[29]They shall eat the food offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
\[30]And the first of all the first-fruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: all of you shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in yours house.

\[3]And of this measure shall you measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.
\[4]The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.
\[5]And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.
\[6]And all of you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, opposite to the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
\[7]And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be opposite to one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.
\[8]In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
\[9]Thus says the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, says the Lord GOD.
\[10]All of you shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
\[11]The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.
\[12]And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
\[13]This is the oblation that all of you shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and all of you shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:
\[14]Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, all of you shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:
\[15]And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a food offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, says the Lord GOD.
\[16]All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
\[17]And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and food offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the food offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
\[18]Thus says the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, you shall take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:
\[19]And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
\[20]And so you shall do the seventh day of the month for every one that errs, and for him that is simple: so shall all of you reconcile the house.
\[21]In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, all of you shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
\[22]And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.
\[23]And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.
\[24]And he shall prepare a food offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.
\[25]In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the food offering, and according to the oil.

hus says the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
\[2]And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
\[3]Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
\[4]And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
\[5]And the food offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the food offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\[6]And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.
\[7]And he shall prepare a food offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\[8]And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
\[9]But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that enters in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that enters by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth opposite to it.
\[10]And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.
\[11]And in the feasts and in the solemnities the food offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
\[12]Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looks toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
\[13]You shall daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: you shall prepare it every morning.
\[14]And you shall prepare a food offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a food offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.
\[15]Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the food offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.
\[16]Thus says the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.
\[17]But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.
\[18]Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
\[19]After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.
\[20]Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the food offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.
\[21]Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
\[22]In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.
\[23]And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.
\[24]Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

fterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.
\[2]Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looks eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
\[3]And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.
\[4]Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.
\[5]Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.
\[6]And he said unto me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
\[7]Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\[8]Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.
\[9]And it shall come to pass, that every thing that lives, which moves, anywhere the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live where the river comes.
\[10]And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
\[11]But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
\[12]And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine.
\[13]Thus says the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby all of you shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.
\[14]And all of you shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
\[15]And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;
\[16]Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.
\[17]And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.
\[18]And the east side all of you shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.
\[19]And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.
\[20]The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come opposite to Hamath. This is the west side.
\[21]So shall all of you divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
\[22]And it shall come to pass, that all of you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall brought forth children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns, there shall all of you give him his inheritance, says the Lord GOD.

n the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
\[2]And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
\[3]And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;
\[4]Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
\[5]And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
\[6]Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
\[7]Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
\[8]But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
\[9]Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
\[10]And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the children which are of your sort? then shall all of you make me endanger my head to the king.
\[11]Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\[12]Prove your servants, I plead to you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.
\[13]Then let our countenances be looked upon before you, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's food: and as you see, deal with your servants.
\[14]So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
\[15]And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's food.
\[16]Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables.
\[17]As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
\[18]Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
\[19]And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
\[20]And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.
\[21]And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

nd in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.
\[2]Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, in order to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
\[3]And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
\[4]Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
\[5]The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if all of you will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, all of you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
\[6]But if all of you show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, all of you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
\[7]They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
\[8]The king answered and said, I know of certainty that all of you would gain the time, because all of you see the thing is gone from me.
\[9]But if all of you will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for all of you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that all of you can show me the interpretation thereof.
\[10]The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
\[11]And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
\[12]For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
\[13]And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
\[14]Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:
\[15]He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
\[16]Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.
\[17]Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
\[18]That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
\[19]Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\[20]Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
\[21]And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
\[22]He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.
\[23]I thank you, and praise you, O you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have made known unto me now what we desired of you: for you have now made known unto us the king's matter.
\[24]Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.
\[25]Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
\[26]The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
\[27]Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king;
\[28]But there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets, and makes known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, are these;
\[29]As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind upon your bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass.
\[30]But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.
\[31]You, O king, saw, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and the form thereof was terrible.
\[32]This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
\[33]His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
\[34]You saw till that a stone was cut out without hands, which stroke the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.
\[35]Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that stroke the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
\[36]This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
\[37]You, O king, are a king of kings: for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
\[38]And where ever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into yours hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.
\[39]And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
\[40]And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things: and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
\[41]And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.
\[42]And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
\[43]And whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
\[44]And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
\[45]Forasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
\[46]Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
\[47]The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Truthfully it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret.
\[48]Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
\[49]Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

ebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

\[3]Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\[4]Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
\[5]That at what time all of you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, all of you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up:
\[6]And whoso falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[7]Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\[8]Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
\[9]They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
\[10]You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
\[11]And whoso falls not down and worships, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
\[12]There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: they serve not your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.
\[13]Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
\[14]Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not all of you serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
\[15]Now if all of you be ready that at what time all of you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, all of you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if all of you worship not, all of you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
\[16]Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer you in this matter.
\[17]If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of yours hand, O king.
\[18]But if not, be it known unto you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.
\[19]Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was known to be heated.
\[20]And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
\[21]Then these men were bound in their coats, their upper garments, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[22]Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
\[23]And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
\[24]Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
\[25]He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
\[26]Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, all of you servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came out of the midst of the fire.
\[27]And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
\[28]Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
\[29]Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
\[30]Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.

ebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
\[2]I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God has wrought toward me.
\[3]How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
\[4]I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:
\[5]I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[6]Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
\[7]Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
\[8]But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,
\[9]O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
\[10]Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.
\[11]The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
\[12]The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
\[13]I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;
\[14]He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:
\[15]Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
\[16]Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
\[17]This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the base of men.
\[18]This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.
\[19]Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to yours enemies.
\[20]The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
\[21]Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
\[22]It is you, O king, that are grown and become strong: for your greatness is grown, and reachs unto heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.
\[23]And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
\[24]This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which has come upon my lord the king:
\[25]That they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.
\[26]And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom shall be sure unto you, after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule.
\[27]Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and yours iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquillity.
\[28]All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
\[29]At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
\[30]The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?
\[31]While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from you.
\[32]And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.
\[33]The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.
\[34]And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:
\[35]And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What do you?
\[36]At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
\[37]Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to bring low.

elshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
\[2]Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
\[3]Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
\[4]They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
\[5]In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote opposite to the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
\[6]Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees stroke one against another.
\[7]The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[8]Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.
\[9]Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished.
\[10]Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever: let not your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance be changed:
\[11]There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
\[12]Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
\[13]Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Are you that Daniel, which are of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?
\[14]I have even heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in you.
\[15]And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:
\[16]And I have heard of you, that you can make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if you can read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, you shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[17]Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
\[18]O you king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:
\[19]And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
\[20]But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
\[21]And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appoints over it whomsoever he will.
\[22]And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yours heart, though you knew all this;
\[23]But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:
\[24]Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
\[25]And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
\[26]This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it.
\[27]TEKEL; You are weighed in the balances, and are found lacking.
\[28]PERES; Your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
\[29]Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
\[30]In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
\[31]And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.

t pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;
\[2]And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.
\[3]Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
\[4]Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
\[5]Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
\[6]Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
\[7]All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
\[8]Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.
\[9]Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
\[10]Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did in old times.
\[11]Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
\[12]Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree; Have you not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.
\[13]Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regards not you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.
\[14]Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
\[15]Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.
\[16]Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.
\[17]And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
\[18]Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
\[19]Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
\[20]And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?
\[21]Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
\[22]My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no hurt.
\[23]Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
\[24]And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces before even they came at the bottom of the den.
\[25]Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
\[26]I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
\[27]He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
\[28]So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

n the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.
\[2]Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
\[3]And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
\[4]The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
\[5]And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
\[6]After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
\[7]After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
\[8]I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
\[9]I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
\[10]A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
\[11]I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
\[12]As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
\[13]I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
\[14]And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
\[15]I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
\[16]I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
\[17]These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.
\[18]But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
\[19]Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
\[20]And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.
\[21]I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
\[22]Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
\[23]Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
\[24]And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
\[25]And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
\[26]But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
\[27]And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
\[28]Until now is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

n the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
\[2]And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
\[3]Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
\[4]I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
\[5]And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
\[6]And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
\[7]And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and stroke the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
\[8]Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
\[9]And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.
\[10]And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
\[11]Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.
\[12]And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
\[13]Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
\[14]And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
\[15]And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
\[16]And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
\[17]So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.
\[18]Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
\[19]And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.
\[20]The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
\[21]And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
\[22]Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
\[23]And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
\[24]And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
\[25]And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
\[26]And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut you up the vision; for it shall be for many days.
\[27]And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.

n the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
\[2]In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
\[3]And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
\[4]And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
\[5]We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from your precepts and from your judgments:
\[6]Neither have we hearkened unto your servants the prophets, which spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
\[7]O LORD, righteousness belongs unto you, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.
\[8]O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.
\[9]To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
\[10]Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
\[11]Yea, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
\[12]And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem.
\[13]As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand your truth.
\[14]Therefore has the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice.
\[15]And now, O Lord our God, that have brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have got you renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
\[16]O LORD, according to all your righteousness, I plead to you, let yours anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach to all that are about us.
\[17]Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.
\[18]O my God, incline yours ear, and hear; open yours eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies.
\[19]O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for yours own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.
\[20]And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;
\[21]Yea, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
\[22]And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill and understanding.
\[23]At the beginning of your supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show you; for you are greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
\[24]Seventy weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
\[25]Know therefore and understand, that from the going out of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
\[26]And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
\[27]And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

n the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
\[2]In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
\[3]I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
\[4]And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;
\[5]Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
\[6]His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
\[7]And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.
\[8]Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my loveliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
\[9]Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.
\[10]And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
\[11]And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto you, and stand upright: for unto you am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
\[12]Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set yours heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I am come for your words.
\[13]But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
\[14]Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.
\[15]And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.
\[16]And, behold, one like the embodiment of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
\[17]For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.
\[18]Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
\[19]And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto you, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.
\[20]Then said he, Know you wherefore I come unto you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.
\[21]But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.

lso I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
\[2]And now will I show you the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
\[3]And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
\[4]And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
\[5]And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
\[6]And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that brings forth her, and he that strengthened her in these times.
\[7]But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:
\[8]And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.
\[9]So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.
\[10]But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.
\[11]And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
\[12]And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.
\[13]For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
\[14]And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of your people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
\[15]So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.
\[16]But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
\[17]He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.
\[18]After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
\[19]Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.
\[20]Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
\[21]And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
\[22]And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
\[23]And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.
\[24]He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.
\[25]And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
\[26]Yea, they that feed of the portion of his food shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.
\[27]And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at the same table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
\[28]Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.
\[29]At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
\[30]For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.
\[31]And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.
\[32]And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
\[33]And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.
\[34]Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
\[35]And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.
\[36]And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.
\[37]Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.
\[38]But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
\[39]Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
\[40]And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
\[41]He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
\[42]He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
\[43]But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
\[44]But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.
\[45]And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

\[6]And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?

\[8]And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?
\[9]And he said, Go your way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.

he word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\[2]The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto you a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land has committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.
\[3]So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.
\[4]And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
\[5]And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.
\[6]And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
\[7]But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
\[8]Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
\[9]Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for all of you are not my people, and I will not be your God.
\[10]Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, All of you are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, All of you are the sons of the living God.
\[11]Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

\[2]Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
\[3]Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
\[4]And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.
\[5]For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
\[6]Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
\[7]And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
\[8]For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.
\[9]Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.
\[10]And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.
\[11]I will also cause all her delight to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
\[12]And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she has said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
\[13]And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgotten about me, says the LORD.
\[14]Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
\[15]And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
\[16]And it shall be at that day, says the LORD, that you shall call me Ishi; and shall call me no more Baali.
\[17]For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
\[18]And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.
\[19]And I will betroth you unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth you unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies.
\[20]I will even betroth you unto me in faithfulness: and you shall know the LORD.
\[21]And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, says the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;
\[22]And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.
\[23]And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, You are my people; and they shall say, You are my God.

\[3]Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwells therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
\[4]Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for your people are as they that strive with the priest.
\[5]Therefore shall you fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night, and I will destroy your mother.
\[6]My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you shall be no priest to me: seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.
\[7]As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.
\[8]They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
\[9]And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
\[10]For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
\[11]Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
\[12]My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declares unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms has caused them to go astray, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
\[13]They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
\[14]I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that does not understand shall fall.
\[15]Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not all of you unto Gilgal, neither go all of you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.
\[16]For Israel slides back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
\[17]Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

\[9]Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
\[10]The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
\[11]Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
\[12]Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
\[13]When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
\[14]For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.

\[27]And all of you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.

\[29]And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.

he words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
\[2]And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
\[3]Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:
\[4]But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.
\[5]I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, says the LORD.
\[6]Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:
\[7]But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:
\[8]And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holds the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord GOD.
\[9]Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:
\[10]But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.
\[11]Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:
\[12]But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
\[13]Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:
\[14]But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:
\[15]And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, says the LORD.

hus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
\[2]But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:
\[3]And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, says the LORD.
\[4]Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to go astray, after the which their fathers have walked:
\[5]But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
\[6]Thus says the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;
\[7]That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:
\[8]And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.
\[9]Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
\[10]Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
\[11]And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O all of you children of Israel? says the LORD.
\[12]But all of you gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
\[13]Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.
\[14]Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:
\[15]Neither shall he stand that handles the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rides the horse deliver himself.
\[16]And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says the LORD.

\[2]You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
\[3]Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
\[4]Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
\[5]Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no animal trap is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?
\[6]Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD has not done it?
\[7]Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he reveals his secret unto his servants the prophets.
\[8]The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy?
\[9]Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.
\[10]For they know not to do right, says the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
\[11]Therefore thus says the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be spoiled.
\[12]Thus says the LORD; As the shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.
\[13]Hear all of you, and testify in the house of Jacob, says the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,
\[14]That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.
\[15]And I will strike the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, says the LORD.

\[3]And all of you shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and all of you shall cast them into the palace, says the LORD.
\[4]Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:
\[5]And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this likes you, O all of you children of Israel, says the Lord GOD.
\[6]And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places: yet have all of you not returned unto me, says the LORD.
\[7]And also I have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
\[8]So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have all of you not returned unto me, says the LORD.
\[9]I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have all of you not returned unto me, says the LORD.
\[10]I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have all of you not returned unto me, says the LORD.
\[11]I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and all of you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have all of you not returned unto me, says the LORD.
\[12]Therefore thus will I do unto you, O Israel: and because I will do this unto you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.

ear all of you this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.
\[2]The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
\[3]For thus says the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
\[4]For thus says the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek all of you me, and all of you shall live:
\[5]But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.
\[6]Seek the LORD, and all of you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.
\[7]All of you who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,
\[8]Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:
\[9]That strengthens the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
\[10]They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they detest him that speaks uprightly.
\[11]Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and all of you take from him burdens of wheat: all of you have built houses of hewn stone, but all of you shall not dwell in them; all of you have planted pleasant vineyards, but all of you shall not drink wine of them.
\[12]For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.
\[13]Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.
\[14]Seek good, and not evil, that all of you may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as all of you have spoken.
\[15]Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
\[16]Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, says thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the farmer to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.
\[17]And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through you, says the LORD.
\[18]Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.
\[19]As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
\[20]Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
\[21]I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
\[22]Though all of you offer me burnt offerings and your food offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
\[23]Take you away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols.
\[24]But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
\[25]Have all of you offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
\[26]But all of you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which all of you made to yourselves.
\[27]Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

\[9]And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
\[10]And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold your tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.
\[11]For, behold, the LORD commands, and he will strike the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
\[12]Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for all of you have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
\[13]All of you which rejoice in a thing of nothing, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?

hus has the Lord GOD showed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.
\[2]And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I plead to you: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.
\[3]The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, says the LORD.
\[4]Thus has the Lord GOD showed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.
\[5]Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I plead to you: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.
\[6]The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, says the Lord GOD.
\[7]Thus he showed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.
\[8]And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what see you? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:
\[9]And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
\[10]Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
\[11]For thus Amos says, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
\[12]Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O you seer, go, flee you away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
\[13]But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.
\[14]Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
\[15]And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
\[16]Now therefore hear you the word of the LORD: You says, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not your word against the house of Isaac.
\[17]Therefore thus says the LORD; Your wife shall be an harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you shall die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity out of his land.

\[3]And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, says the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.
\[4]Hear this, O all of you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
\[5]Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
\[6]That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
\[7]The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
\[8]Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwells therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.
\[9]And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:
\[10]And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
\[11]Behold, the days come, says the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:
\[12]And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run back and forth to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.
\[13]In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

\[2]Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

\[12]That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, says the LORD that does this.
\[13]Behold, the days come, says the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
\[14]And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\[15]And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, says the LORD your God.

\[3]The pride of yours heart has deceived you, you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that says in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
\[4]Though you exalt yourself as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, thence will I bring you down, says the LORD.
\[5]If thieves came to you, if robbers by night, (how are you cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some grapes?
\[6]How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!
\[7]All the men of your confederacy have brought you even to the border: the men that were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you; that they eat your bread have laid a wound under you: there is none understanding in him.
\[8]Shall I not in that day, says the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\[9]And your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
\[10]For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.
\[11]In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.
\[12]But you should not have looked on the day of your brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither should you have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
\[13]You should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, you should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;
\[14]Neither should you have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither should you have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.
\[15]For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as you have done, it shall be done unto you: your reward shall return upon yours own head.
\[16]For as all of you have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
\[17]But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
\[18]And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it.
\[19]And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
\[20]And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.

\[2]Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness has come up before me.
\[3]But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
\[4]But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
\[5]Then the seamen were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
\[6]So the ship captain came to him, and said unto him, What mean you, O sleeper? arise, call upon your God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
\[7]And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
\[8]Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray you, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is yours occupation? and whence come you? what is your country? and of what people are you?
\[9]And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which has made the sea and the dry land.
\[10]Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why have you done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
\[11]Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto you, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
\[12]And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
\[13]Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.
\[14]Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We plead to you, O LORD, we plead to you, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for you, O LORD, have done as it pleased you.
\[15]So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.

\[2]Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid you.
\[3]So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.
\[4]And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
\[5]So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
\[6]For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
\[7]And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:
\[8]But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
\[9]Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?

\[3]Therefore now, O LORD, take, I plead to you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.
\[4]Then said the LORD, Do you well to be angry?
\[5]So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.
\[6]And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.
\[7]But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it stroke the gourd that it withered.
\[8]And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
\[9]And God said to Jonah, Do you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.
\[10]Then said the LORD, You have had pity on the gourd, for the which you have not laboured, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:

\[2]Hear, all you people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy temple.
\[3]For, behold, the LORD comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
\[4]And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.
\[5]For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
\[6]Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.
\[7]And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.
\[8]Therefore I will wail and wail, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
\[9]For her wound is incurable; for it has come unto Judah; he has come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
\[10]Declare all of you it not at Gath, weep all of you not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll yourself in the dust.
\[11]Pass all of you away, you inhabitant of Saphir, having your shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.
\[12]For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
\[13]O you inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
\[14]Therefore shall you give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.
\[15]Yet will I bring an heir unto you, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

\[11]Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.
\[12]Are you not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, you have ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, you have established them for correction.
\[13]You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity: wherefore look you upon them that deal treacherously, and hold your tongue when the wicked devours the man that is more righteous than he?
\[14]And make men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
\[15]They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.
\[16]Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their food abundant.
\[17]Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?

\[2]And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that reads it.
\[3]For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
\[4]Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
\[5]Yea also, because he trangresses by wine, he is a proud man, neither keeps at home, who enlarges his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathers unto him all nations, and heaps unto him all people:
\[6]Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increases that which is not his! how long? and to him that loads himself with thick clay!
\[7]Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite you, and awake that shall vex you, and you shall be for booties unto them?
\[8]Because you have spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil you; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
\[9]Woe to him that covers an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!
\[10]You have consulted shame to your house by cutting off many people, and have sinned against your soul.
\[11]For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
\[12]Woe to him that builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!
\[13]Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?
\[14]For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
\[15]Woe unto him that gives his neighbour drink, that put your bottle to him, and make him drunken also, that you may look on their nakedness!
\[16]You are filled with shame for glory: drink you also, and let your foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto you, and shameful spewing shall be on your glory.
\[17]For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
\[18]What profits the graven image that the maker thereof has graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusts therein, to make dumb idols?
\[19]Woe unto him that says to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

 prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
\[2]O LORD, I have heard your speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive your work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
\[3]God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
\[4]And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.
\[5]Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
\[6]He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.
\[7]I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
\[8]Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was yours anger against the rivers? was your wrath against the sea, that you did ride upon yours horses and your chariots of salvation?
\[9]Your bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even your word. Selah. You did cleave the earth with rivers.
\[10]The mountains saw you, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.
\[11]The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of yours arrows they went, and at the shining of your glittering spear.
\[12]You did march through the land in indignation, you did thresh the heathen in anger.
\[13]You went forth for the salvation of your people, even for salvation with yours anointed; you wounded the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
\[14]You did strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
\[15]You did walk through the sea with yours horses, through the heap of great waters.
\[16]When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he comes up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.
\[17]Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no food; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
\[18]Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
\[19]The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

he word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
\[2]I will utterly consume all things from off the land, says the LORD.
\[3]I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, says the LORD.
\[4]I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;
\[5]And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;
\[6]And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.
\[7]Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guest.
\[8]And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.
\[9]In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.
\[10]And it shall come to pass in that day, says the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.
\[11]Wail, all of you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.
\[12]And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their sediments of wine: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.
\[13]Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.
\[14]The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hastes greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.
\[15]That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of devastation and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
\[16]A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.
\[17]And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.
\[18]Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy purging of all them that dwell in the land.

\[6]And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.
\[7]And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.
\[8]I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.

\[12]All of you Ethiopians also, all of you shall be slain by my sword.
\[13]And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.

\[2]She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

\[4]Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.

\[9]For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.

\[12]I will also leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

\[15]The LORD has taken away your judgments, he has cast out yours enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of you: you shall not see evil any more.
\[16]In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear you not: and to Zion, Let not yours hands be slack.
\[17]The LORD your God in the midst of you is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over you with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over you with singing.
\[18]I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of you, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.
\[19]Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict you: and I will save her that haltes, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.
\[20]At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, says the LORD.

n the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
\[2]Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.
\[3]Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[4]Is it time for you, O all of you, to dwell in your covered over houses, and this house lie waste?
\[5]Now therefore thus says the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
\[6]All of you have sown much, and bring in little; all of you eat, but all of you have not enough; all of you drink, but all of you are not filled with drink; all of you clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earns wages earns wages to put it into a bag with holes.
\[7]Thus says the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.
\[8]Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says the LORD.
\[9]All of you looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when all of you brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? says the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and all of you run every man unto his own house.
\[10]Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.
\[11]And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.
\[12]Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.
\[13]Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, says the LORD.
\[14]And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,

n the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,
\[2]Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,
\[3]Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do all of you see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
\[4]Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land, says the LORD, and work: for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts:
\[5]According to the word that I covenanted with you when all of you came out of Egypt, so my spirit remains among you: fear all of you not.
\[6]For thus says the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
\[7]And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of hosts.
\[8]The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts.
\[9]The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, says the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, says the LORD of hosts.
\[10]In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
\[11]Thus says the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
\[12]If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
\[13]Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
\[14]Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, says the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
\[15]And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:
\[16]Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat in order to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.
\[17]I stroke you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet all of you turned not to me, says the LORD.
\[18]Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.
\[19]Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.
\[20]And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,
\[21]Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
\[22]And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
\[23]In that day, says the LORD of hosts, will I take you, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, says the LORD, and will make you as a signet: for I have chosen you, says the LORD of hosts.

\[6]But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.

\[8]I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.
\[9]Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show you what these be.
\[10]And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk back and forth through the earth.
\[11]And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked back and forth through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.
\[12]Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these threescore and ten years?
\[13]And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.
\[14]So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry you, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
\[15]And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
\[16]Therefore thus says the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
\[17]Cry yet, saying, Thus says the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
\[18]Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
\[19]And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
\[20]And the LORD showed me four carpenters.
\[21]Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to frighten them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

\[13]Therefore it has come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, says the LORD of hosts:

\[5]And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.

\[8]And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.

\[10]For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.

\[13]And it shall come to pass, that as all of you were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and all of you shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.
\[14]For thus says the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, says the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:
\[15]So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear all of you not.
\[16]These are the things that all of you shall do; Speak all of you every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:

\[6]The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.
\[7]For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
\[8]But all of you are departed out of the way; all of you have caused many to stumble at the law; all of you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts.
\[9]Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as all of you have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
\[10]Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\[11]Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and has married the daughter of a strange god.
\[12]The LORD will cut off the man that does this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offers an offering unto the LORD of hosts.
\[13]And this have all of you done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regards not the offering any more, or receives it with good will at your hand.
\[14]Yet all of you say, Wherefore? Because the LORD has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously: yet is she your companion, and the wife of your covenant.
\[15]And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
\[16]For the LORD, the God of Israel, says that he hates putting away: for one covers violence with his garment, says the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that all of you deal not treacherously.
\[17]All of you have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet all of you say, Wherein have we wearied him? When all of you say, Every one that does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

ehold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom all of you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom all of you delight in: behold, he shall come, says the LORD of hosts.
\[2]But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:
\[3]And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.
\[4]Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
\[5]And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the worker in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, says the LORD of hosts.
\[6]For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore all of you sons of Jacob are not consumed.
\[7]Even from the days of your fathers all of you are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, says the LORD of hosts. But all of you said, Wherein shall we return?
\[8]Will a man rob God? Yet all of you have robbed me. But all of you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.
\[9]All of you are cursed with a curse: for all of you have robbed me, even this whole nation.
\[10]Bring all of you all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in mine house, and prove me now herewith, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
\[11]And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, says the LORD of hosts.
\[12]And all nations shall call you blessed: for all of you shall be a delightsome land, says the LORD of hosts.
\[13]Your words have been stout against me, says the LORD. Yet all of you say, What have we spoken so much against you?
\[14]All of you have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
\[15]And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.
\[16]Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.
\[17]And they shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him.
\[18]Then shall all of you return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that serves him not.

or, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, says the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
\[2]But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and all of you shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
\[3]And all of you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, says the LORD of hosts.
\[4]Remember all of you the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.
\[5]Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:
\[6]And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.
