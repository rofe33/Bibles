he book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
\[2]Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
\[3]And Judah begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
\[4]And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
\[5]And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
\[6]And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her [that had been the wife] of Uriah;
\[7]And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
\[8]And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
\[9]And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
\[10]And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
\[11]And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
\[12]And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
\[13]And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
\[14]And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
\[15]And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
\[16]And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\[17]So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ [are] fourteen generations.
\[18]Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit.
\[19]Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man], and not willing to make her a public example, purposed to put her away privately.
\[20]But while he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.
\[21]And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
\[22]Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying,
\[23]Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
\[24]Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:
\[25]And knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name JESUS.

ow, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
\[2]Saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.
\[3]When Herod the king had heard [these things], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
\[4]And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.
\[5]And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
\[6]And thou Bethlehem, [in] the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
\[7]Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
\[8]And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go, and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found [him], bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
\[9]When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
\[10]When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
\[11]And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshiped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
\[12]And being warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
\[13]And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
\[14]When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
\[15]And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
\[16]Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
\[17]Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
\[18]In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
\[19]But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\[20]Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead who sought the young child's life.
\[21]And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
\[22]But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
\[23]And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

n those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
\[2]And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\[3]For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\[4]And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
\[5]Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region about Jordan,
\[6]And were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
\[7]But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\[8]Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
\[9]And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
\[10]And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\[11]I indeed baptize you with water to repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and [with] fire:
\[12]Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and gather his wheat into the granary; but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.
\[13]Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
\[14]But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?
\[15]And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it to be so] now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
\[16]And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
\[17]And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

hen was Jesus led by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
\[2]And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry.
\[3]And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
\[4]But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
\[5]Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
\[6]And saith to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in [their] hands they shall uphold thee, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\[7]Jesus said to him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\[8]Again, the devil taketh him up upon an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,
\[9]And saith to him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
\[10]Then saith Jesus to him, Be gone, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
\[11]Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.
\[12]Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee.
\[13]And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;
\[14]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\[15]The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, [by] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
\[16]The people who sat in darkness, saw great light; and to them who sat in the region and shades of death, light hath arisen.
\[17]From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\[18]And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
\[19]And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
\[20]And they immediately left [their] nets, and followed him.
\[21]And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them.
\[22]And they immediately left the boat, and their father, and followed him.
\[23]And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease among the people.
\[24]And his fame spread throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments, and those who were possessed with demons, and those who were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
\[25]And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and [from] Decapolis, and [from] Jerusalem, and [from] Judea, and [from] beyond Jordan.

nd seeing the multitudes, he ascended a mountain: and when he was seated, his disciples came to him.
\[2]And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
\[3]Blessed [are] the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\[4]Blessed [are] they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
\[5]Blessed [are] the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
\[6]Blessed [are] they who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall be filled.
\[7]Blessed [are] the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
\[8]Blessed [are] the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
\[9]Blessed [are] the peace-makers: for they shall be called children of God.
\[10]Blessed [are] they who are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\[11]Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute [you], and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
\[12]Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great [is] your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
\[13]Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt hath lost its savor, with what shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men.
\[14]Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.
\[15]Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a close vessel, but on a candlestick: and it giveth light to all that are in the house.
\[16]Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
\[17]Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
\[18]For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth shall pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
\[19]Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do, and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\[20]For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\[21]Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill, shall be in danger of the judgment:
\[22]But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell-fire.
\[23]Therefore if thou shalt bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee;
\[24]Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
\[25]Agree with thy adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
\[26]Verily, I say to thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
\[27]Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
\[28]But I say to you, That whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
\[29]And if thy right eye shall cause thee to sin, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: for [it] is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.
\[30]And if thy right hand shall cause thee to sin, cut it off, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be cast into hell.
\[31]It hath been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
\[32]But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of lewdness, causeth her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced, committeth adultery.
\[33]Again, ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform to the Lord thy oaths:
\[34]But I say to you, Swear not at all: neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
\[35]Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King,
\[36]Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
\[37]But let your communication be, Yea, yea, Nay, nay: for whatever [is] more than these cometh of evil.
\[38]Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
\[39]But I say to you, That ye resist not evil: but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
\[40]And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also.
\[41]And whoever shall constrain thee [to go] one mile, go with him two.
\[42]Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away.
\[43]Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy enemy:
\[44]But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you, and persecute you;
\[45]That ye may be the children of your Father who [is] in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
\[46]For if ye love them who love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
\[47]And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]? do not even the publicans so?
\[48]Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.

ake heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen by them: otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\[2]Therefore, when thou doest [thy] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Verily, I say to you, they have their reward.
\[3]But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
\[4]That thy alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, himself will reward thee openly.
\[5]And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Verily, I say to you, they have their reward.
\[6]But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.
\[7]But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
\[8]Therefore be ye not like them: for your Father knoweth what things ye need before ye ask him.
\[9]After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
\[10]Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as [it is] in heaven.
\[11]Give us this day our daily bread.
\[12]And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
\[13]And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
\[14]For, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
\[15]But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
\[16]Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Verily, I say to you, they have their reward.
\[17]But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
\[18]That thou mayest not appear to men to fast, but to thy Father, who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
\[19]Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
\[20]But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
\[21]For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\[22]The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye be single, thy whole body will be full of light.
\[23]But if thy eye be evil, thy whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness, how great [is] that darkness!
\[24]No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
\[25]Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?
\[26]Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
\[27]Which of you by anxious care can add one cubit to his stature?
\[28]And why are ye anxious for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow? they toil not, neither do they spin?
\[29]And yet I say to you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\[30]Wherefore, if God so clotheth the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, [will he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
\[31]Therefore be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or, with what shall we be clothed?
\[32](For after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
\[33]But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
\[34]Therefore be not anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be solicitous for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day [is] its own evil.

udge not, that ye be not judged.
\[2]For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and the measure which ye give, shall be measured to you again.
\[3]And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye?
\[4]Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thy eye; and behold, a beam [is] in thy own eye?
\[5]Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thy own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
\[6]Give not that which [is] holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
\[7]Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you:
\[8]For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door shall be opened.
\[9]Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask bread, will give him a stone?
\[10]Or if he shall ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
\[11]If ye then being evil know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
\[12]Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
\[13]Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.
\[14]Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth to life, and few there are that find it.
\[15]Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
\[16]Ye shall know them by their fruits: Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles:
\[17]Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
\[18]A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
\[19]Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\[20]Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them,
\[21]Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\[22]Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out demons? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
\[23]And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
\[24]Therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock:
\[25]And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
\[26]And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
\[27]And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.
\[28]And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine.

\[8]The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant will be healed.
\[9]For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this [man], Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].
\[10]When Jesus heard [it], he marveled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

\[12]But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into utter darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\[13]And Jesus said to the centurion, Depart; and as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And his servant was healed in the same hour.
\[14]And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick with a fever.
\[15]And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them.
\[16]When the evening was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with [his] word, and healed all that were sick;
\[17]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, He himself took our infirmities, and bore [our] sicknesses.
\[18]Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side.
\[19]And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
\[20]And Jesus saith to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.
\[21]And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\[22]But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.
\[23]And when he had entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.
\[24]And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
\[25]And his disciples came to [him], and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.
\[26]And he saith to them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
\[27]But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
\[28]And when he had come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
\[29]And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we [to do] with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
\[30]And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine, feeding.
\[31]So the demons besought him, saying, If thou expellest us, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
\[32]And he said to them, Go. And when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine: and behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.
\[33]And they that kept them, fled, and went into the city, and told every thing; and what had befallen to the possessed with demons.
\[34]And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their borders.

nd he entered into a boat, and passed over, and came into his own city.
\[2]And behold, they brought to him a man sick with the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven thee.
\[3]And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This [man] blasphemeth.
\[4]And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why think ye evil in your hearts?
\[5]For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?
\[6]But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick with the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house.
\[7]And he arose, and departed to his house.
\[8]But when the multitude saw [it], they marveled, and glorified God, who had given such power to men.
\[9]And as Jesus was passing from thence, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
\[10]And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
\[11]And when the Pharisees saw [it], they said to his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
\[12]But when Jesus heard [that], he said to them, They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are sick.
\[13]But go ye and learn what [that] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\[14]Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples fast not?
\[15]And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.
\[16]No man putteth a piece of new cloth to an old garment: for that which is put in to fill it up, taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
\[17]Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
\[18]While he was speaking these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshiped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she will live.
\[19]And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.
\[20](And behold, a woman who was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind [him], and touched the hem of his garment.
\[21]For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
\[22]But Jesus turned himself about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.)
\[23]And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
\[24]He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they derided him.
\[25]But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
\[26]And the fame of this went abroad into all that land.
\[27]And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, [Thou] son of David, have mercy on us.
\[28]And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.
\[29]Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it to you.
\[30]And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See [that] no man know [it].
\[31]But they, when they had departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
\[32]As thy went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
\[33]And when the demon was cast out, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
\[34]But the Pharisees said, He casteth out demons, through the prince of the demons.
\[35]And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness, and every disease among the people.
\[36]But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
\[37]Then saith he to his disciples, The harvest truly [is] plentiful, but the laborers [are] few.
\[38]Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.

nd when he had called to [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease.
\[2]Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;
\[3]Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James [the son] of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was Thaddeus;
\[4]Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\[5]These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and enter ye not into [any] city of the Samaritans.
\[6]But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\[7]And as ye go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\[8]Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons: freely ye have received, freely give.
\[9]Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
\[10]Nor bag for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor a staff: for the workman is worthy of his food.
\[11]And into whatever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till ye go thence.
\[12]And when ye come into a house, salute it.
\[13]And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
\[14]And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart from that house, or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
\[15]Verily, I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for that city.
\[16]Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
\[17]But beware of men: for they will deliver you to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.
\[18]And ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
\[19]But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given to you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
\[20]For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.
\[21]And the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children will rise up against [their] parents, and cause them to be put to death.
\[22]And ye will be hated by all [men] for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
\[23]But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say to you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man shall have come.
\[24]The disciple is not above [his] teacher, nor the servant above his lord.
\[25]It is enough for the disciple that he should be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord: if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [will they call] them of his household?
\[26]Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
\[27]What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] publish ye upon the house-tops.
\[28]And fear not them who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\[29]Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father.
\[30]But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
\[31]Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
\[32]Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
\[33]But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
\[34]Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
\[35]For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\[36]And a man's foes [will be] they of his own household.
\[37]He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.
\[38]And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth me, is not worthy of me.
\[39]He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it.
\[40]He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
\[41]He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.
\[42]And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones, a cup of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple, verily, I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

nd it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
\[2]Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
\[3]And said to him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
\[4]Jesus answered and said to them, Go and show John again those things which ye hear and see:
\[5]The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
\[6]And blessed is [he] to whom I shall not be the cause of his falling into sin.
\[7]And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken with the wind?
\[8]But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft [clothing] are in kings' houses.
\[9]But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
\[10]For this is [he] concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
\[11]Verily, I say to you, among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.
\[12]And from the days of John the Baptist, until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
\[13]For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
\[14]And if ye will receive [it], this is Elijah who was to come.
\[15]He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\[16]But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,
\[17]And saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; We have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented.
\[18]For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.
\[19]The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.
\[20]Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they repented not.
\[21]Woe to thee, Chorazin; woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\[22]But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
\[23]And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
\[24]But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for thee.
\[25]At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.
\[26]Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
\[27]All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will reveal [him].
\[28]Come to me, all [ye] that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
\[29]Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me: for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls.
\[30]For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.

t that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the corn, and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.
\[2]But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.
\[3]But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him;
\[4]How he entered into the house of God, and ate the show-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them who were with him, but only for the priests?
\[5]Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
\[6]But I say to you, that in this place is [one] greater than the temple.
\[7]But if ye had known what [this] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
\[8]For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.
\[9]And when he had departed thence, he went into their synagogue.
\[10]And behold, there was a man who had [his] hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.
\[11]And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it shall fall into a pit on the sabbath, will he not lay hold on it, and lift [it] out?
\[12]How much then is a man better than a sheep? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
\[13]Then saith he to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out; and [it] was restored to a sound state like the other.
\[14]Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
\[15]But when Jesus knew [it], he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.
\[16]And charged them that they should not make him known:
\[17]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\[18]Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.
\[19]He shall not contend, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
\[20]A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he shall send forth judgment to victory.
\[21]And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
\[22]Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.
\[23]And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
\[24]But when the Pharisees heard [it], they said, This [man] doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
\[25]And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself, shall not stand.
\[26]And if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
\[27]And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children expel [them]? therefore they shall be your judges.
\[28]But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.
\[29]Or else, how can one enter into a strong man's house, and seize his goods, except he shall first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.
\[30]He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.
\[31]Wherefore I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy] Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.
\[32]And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the [world] to come.
\[33]Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by [its] fruit.
\[34]O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.
\[35]A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things.
\[36]But I say to you, That for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.
\[37]For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
\[38]Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
\[39]But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah.
\[40]For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly: so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
\[41]The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah [is] here.
\[42]The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here.
\[43]When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and he findeth none.
\[44]Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth [it] empty, swept, and garnished.
\[45]Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation.
\[46]While he was yet speaking to the people, behold, [his] mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
\[47]Then one said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
\[48]But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
\[49]And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
\[50]For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

he same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
\[2]And great multitudes were gathered to him, so that he went into a boat, and sat down; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
\[3]And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
\[4]And when he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them:
\[5]Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
\[6]And when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had not root, they withered.
\[7]And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
\[8]But others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundred-fold, some sixty-fold, some thirty-fold.
\[9]Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\[10]And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?
\[11]He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
\[12]For whoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
\[13]Therefore I speak to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
\[14]And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
\[15]For this people's heart is become gross, and [their] ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and should understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
\[16]But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
\[17]For verily I say to you, That many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see [the things] which ye see, and have not seen [them]; and to hear [the things] which ye hear, and have not heard [them].
\[18]Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
\[19]When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth [it] not, then cometh the wicked [one], and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the way side.
\[20]But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and immediately with joy receiveth it;
\[21]Yet he hath not root in himself, but endureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, forthwith he is offended.
\[22]He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
\[23]But he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth [it]; who also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty.
\[24]Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field:
\[25]But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and departed.
\[26]But when the blade had sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
\[27]So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
\[28]He said to them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said to him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them?
\[29]But he said, No; lest while ye gather the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
\[30]Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
\[31]Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
\[32]Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge on its branches.
\[33]Another parable he spoke to them; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
\[34]All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable he spoke not to them:
\[35]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
\[36]Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Declare to us the parable of the tares of the field.
\[37]He answered and said to them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
\[38]The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
\[39]The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
\[40]As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
\[41]The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them who do iniquity;
\[42]And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\[43]Then shall the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\[44]Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field; which, when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
\[45]Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls:
\[46]Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
\[47]Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
\[48]Which, when it was full, they drew to the shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast away the bad.
\[49]So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
\[50]And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\[51]Jesus saith to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yes, Lord.
\[52]Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe [who is] instructed to the kingdom of heaven, is like a man [that is] a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.
\[53]And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
\[54]And when he had come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these] mighty works?
\[55]Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
\[56]And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this [man] all these things?
\[57]And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.
\[58]And he did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.

t that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
\[2]And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he hath risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
\[3]For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put [him] in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
\[4]For John had said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
\[5]And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
\[6]But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
\[7]Upon which he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.
\[8]And she, being before instructed by her mother, said, Give me here the head of John the Baptist in a dish.

\[11]And his head was brought in a dish, and given to the damsel: and she brought [it] to her mother.
\[12]And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
\[13]When Jesus heard [of it], he departed thence in a boat, into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard [of it], they followed him on foot out of the cities.
\[14]And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion towards them, and he healed their sick.
\[15]And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
\[16]But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
\[17]And they say to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
\[18]He said, Bring them hither to me.
\[19]And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to [his] disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\[20]And they all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
\[21]And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
\[22]And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
\[23]And when he had sent the multitudes away, he ascended a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
\[24]But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
\[25]And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
\[26]And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
\[27]But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
\[28]And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it is thou, bid me come to thee on the water.
\[29]And he said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
\[30]But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
\[31]And immediately Jesus stretched forth [his] hand, and caught him, and said to him, O thou of little faith, Why didst thou doubt?
\[32]And when they had come into the boat, the wind ceased.
\[33]Then they that were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, In truth thou art the son of God.
\[34]And when they had gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
\[35]And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all the surrounding country, and brought to him all that were diseased;
\[36]And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were restored to health.

hen came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, who were of Jerusalem, saying,
\[2]Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
\[3]But he answered and said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
\[4]For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
\[5]But ye say, Whoever shall say to [his] father or [his] mother, [It is] a gift, by whatever thou mightest be profited by me;
\[6]And honor not his father or his mother, [he shall be free]. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.
\[7][Ye] hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
\[8]This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, and honor me with [their] lips; but their heart is far from me.
\[9]But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.
\[10]And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:
\[11]Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
\[12]Then came his disciples, and said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?
\[13]But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be extirpated.
\[14]Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leadeth the blind, both will fall into the ditch.
\[15]Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this parable.
\[16]And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
\[17]Do ye not yet understand, that whatever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
\[18]But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
\[19]For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
\[20]These are [the things] which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
\[21]Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the territories of Tyre and Sidon.
\[22]And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same territories, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, [thou] son of David; my daughter is grievously afflicted with a demon.
\[23]But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
\[24]But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\[25]Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.
\[26]But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] to dogs.
\[27]And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crums which fall from their master's table.
\[28]Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great [is] thy faith: be it to thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
\[29]And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh to the sea of Galilee; and ascended a mountain, and sat down there.
\[30]And great multitudes came to him, having with them [those that were] lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
\[31]So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
\[32]Then Jesus called his disciples [to him], and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
\[33]And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to satisfy so great a multitude?
\[34]And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
\[35]And he commanded the multitude to sit on the ground.
\[36]And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke [them], and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\[37]And they all ate and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that were left seven baskets full.
\[38]And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.
\[39]And he sent away the multitude, and took a boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.

he Pharisees also and the Sadducees came, and, tempting, desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.
\[2]He answered and said to them, When it is evening, ye say, [It will be] fair weather: for the sky is red.
\[3]And in the morning, [It will be] foul weather to-day: for the sky is red and lowering. O [ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not [discern] the signs of the times?
\[4]A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign; and there shall no sign been to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
\[5]And when his disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\[6]Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
\[7]And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have taken no bread.
\[8][Which] when Jesus perceived, he said to them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?
\[9]Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
\[10]Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
\[11]How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
\[12]Then they understood that he did not caution them against the leaven of bread, but against the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
\[13]When Jesus came into the borders of Cesarea Phillippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am?
\[14]And they said, Some [say that thou art] John the Baptist: some Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
\[15]He saith to them, But who say ye that I am?
\[16]And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
\[17]And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon-Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
\[18]And I say also to thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church: and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
\[19]And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
\[20]Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
\[21]From that time forth Jesus began to show to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
\[22]Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be to thee.
\[23]But he turned, and said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offense to me: for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but those that are of men.
\[24]Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
\[25]For whoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
\[26]For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
\[27]For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he will reward every man according to his works.
\[28]Verily I say to you, There are some standing here, who shall not taste death, till they shall see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

nd after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them upon a high mountain apart.
\[2]And [he] was transfigured before them: and his face shone as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
\[3]And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him.
\[4]Then answered Peter, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
\[5]While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.
\[6]And when the disciples heard [it], they fell on their face, and were in great fear.
\[7]And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
\[8]And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
\[9]And as they were descending the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be raised again from the dead.
\[10]And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes, that Elijah must first come?
\[11]And Jesus answered and said to them, Elijah truly will first come, and restore all things:
\[12]But I say to you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they pleased: likewise will also the Son of man suffer by them.
\[13]Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.
\[14]And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a [certain] man kneeling down to him, and saying,
\[15]Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is lunatic, and grievously distressed; for often he falleth into the fire, and often into the water.
\[16]And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
\[17]Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
\[18]And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
\[19]Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
\[20]And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
\[21]However, this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.
\[22]And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men:
\[23]And they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised again: And they were exceedingly grieved.
\[24]And when they had come to Capernaum, they that received tribute-[money], came to Peter, and said, Doth not your Master pay tribute?
\[25]He saith, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? from their own children, or from strangers?
\[26]Peter saith to him, From strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are the children free.
\[27]Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take the fish that first cometh up: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: take that, and give to them for me and thee.

t the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
\[2]And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the midst of them,
\[3]And said, Verily I say to you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\[4]Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\[5]And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth me.
\[6]But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me, to sin, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and [that] he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
\[7]Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh!
\[8]Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to sin, cut them off, and cast [them] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire.
\[9]And if thy eye causeth thee to sin, pluck it out, and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell-fire.
\[10]Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
\[11]For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
\[12]How think ye? if a man hath a hundred sheep, and one of them is gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go to the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray?
\[13]And if he findeth it, verily I say to you, he rejoiceth more over that [sheep], than over the ninety and nine which went not astray.
\[14]Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
\[15]Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
\[16]But if he will not hear [thee], [then] take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
\[17]And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell [it] to the church: but if he shall neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican.
\[18]Verily I say to you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
\[19]Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth, concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
\[20]For where two or three are assembled in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
\[21]Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
\[22]Jesus saith to him, I say not to thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
\[23]Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king who would take account of his servants.
\[24]And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
\[25]But as he had not ability to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
\[26]The servant therefore fell down, and worshiped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
\[27]Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
\[28]But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest.
\[29]And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
\[30]And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
\[31]So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.
\[32]Then his lord, having called him, said to him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
\[33]Shouldst thou not also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
\[34]And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.
\[35]So likewise shall my heavenly Father do to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

nd it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea, beyond Jordan:
\[2]And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
\[3]The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
\[4]And he answered and said to them, Have ye not read, that he who made [them], at the beginning made them male and female,
\[5]And said, For this [cause] shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?
\[6]Wherefore they are no more two, but one flesh. Therefore what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
\[7]They say to him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
\[8]He saith to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
\[9]And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except for lewdness, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoever marrieth her who is put away, committeth adultery.
\[10]His disciples say to him, If the case of the man is so with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.
\[11]But he said to them, All [men] cannot receive this saying, save [they] to whom it is given.
\[12]For there are some eunuchs, who were so born from [their] mothers womb: and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].
\[13]Then were brought to him little children, that he should put [his] hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
\[14]But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
\[15]And he laid [his] hands on them, and departed thence.
\[16]And behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
\[17]And he said to him, Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good but one, [that is], God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
\[18]He saith to him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
\[19]Honor thy father and [thy] mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
\[20]The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept from my youth: what lack I yet?
\[21]Jesus said to him, If thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me.
\[22]But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
\[23]Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I say to you, that a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\[24]And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\[25]When his disciples heard [it], they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
\[26]But Jesus beheld [them], and said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
\[27]Then answered Peter, and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee? what shall we have therefore?
\[28]And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, that ye who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\[29]And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive a hundred-fold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
\[30]But many [that are] first shall be last, and the last [shall be] first.

or the kingdom of heaven is like to a man [that is] a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.
\[2]And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\[3]And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the market-place,
\[4]And said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is right, I will give you. And they departed.
\[5]Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
\[6]And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
\[7]They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is right, [that] shall ye receive.
\[8]So when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them [their] hire, beginning from the last to the first.
\[9]And when they came that [were hired] about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
\[10]But when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
\[11]And when they had received [it], they murmured against the master of the house.
\[12]Saying, These last have wrought [but] one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.
\[13]But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?
\[14]Take [that] which [is] thine, and depart: I will give to this last, even as to thee.
\[15]Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? is thy eye evil because I am good?
\[16]So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many are called, but few chosen.
\[17]And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,
\[18]Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests, and to the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
\[19]And will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify [him]: and the third day he will rise again.
\[20]Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children, with her sons, worshiping [him], and desiring a certain thing of him.
\[21]And he said to her, What wilt thou: She saith to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdom.
\[22]But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.
\[23]And he saith to them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but [it shall be given] to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.
\[24]And when the ten heard [it], they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
\[25]But Jesus called them [to him], and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
\[26]But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
\[27]And whoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
\[28]Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
\[29]And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
\[30]And behold, two blind men sitting by the way-side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, [thou] son of David.
\[31]And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, [thou] son of David.
\[32]And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do to you?
\[33]They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
\[34]So Jesus had compassion [on them], and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

\[2]Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and immediately ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her, loose [them], and bring [them] to me.
\[3]And if any [man] shall say aught to you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and immediately he will send them.

\[15]And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were greatly displeased,
\[16]And said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith to them, Yes: have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
\[17]And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there.
\[18]Now in the morning as he was returning into the city, he was hungry.
\[19]And when he saw a fig-tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever. And immediately the fig-tree withered.
\[20]And when the disciples saw [it], they marveled, saying, How soon is the fig-tree withered!
\[21]Jesus answered and said to them, Verily I say to you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this [which is done] to the fig-tree, but also, if ye shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
\[22]And all things whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
\[23]And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things; and who gave thee this authority?
\[24]And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\[25]The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?
\[26]But if we shall say, From men; we fear the people: for all hold John as a prophet.
\[27]And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
\[28]But what think ye? A [certain] man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go, work to-day in my vineyard.
\[29]He answered and said, I will not; but afterward he repented, and went.
\[30]And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I [go], sir: and went not.
\[31]Which of the two did the will of [his] father? They say to him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
\[32]For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen [it], repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
\[33]Hear another parable; There was a certain householder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged it around, and digged a wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a remote country:
\[34]And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
\[35]And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
\[36]Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them in like manner.
\[37]But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
\[38]But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
\[39]And they caught him, and cast [him] out of the vineyard, and slew [him].
\[40]When therefore the Lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those husbandmen?
\[41]They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out [his] vineyard to other husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.
\[42]Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
\[43]Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it.
\[44]And whoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
\[45]And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.
\[46]But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

nd Jesus answered, and spoke to them again by parables, and said,
\[2]The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, who made a marriage for his son,
\[3]And sent his servants to call them that were invited to the wedding: and they would not come.
\[4]Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell them who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my] fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come to the marriage.
\[5]But they made light of [it], and went, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.
\[6]And the remnant took his servants, and treated [them] spitefully, and slew [them].
\[7]But when the king heard [of it], he was wroth: and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
\[8]Then he saith to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy.
\[9]Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, invite to the marriage.
\[10]So those servants went out into the highways, and collected all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
\[11]And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not a wedding-garment:
\[12]And he saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
\[13]Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into utter darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\[14]For many are called, but few [are] chosen.
\[15]Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in [his] talk.
\[16]And they sent out to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any [man]: for thou regardest not the person of men.
\[17]Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?
\[18]But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, [ye] hypocrites?
\[19]Show me the tribute-money. And they brought to him a penny.
\[20]And he saith to them, Whose [is] this image, and superscription?
\[21]They say to him, Cesar's. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesar's; and to God, the things that are God's.
\[22]When they had heard [these words], they marveled, and left him, and departed.
\[23]The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
\[24]Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man shall die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
\[25]Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased; and having no issue, left his wife to his brother.
\[26]Likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
\[27]And last of all the woman died also.
\[28]Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
\[29]Jesus answered and said to them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
\[30]For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
\[31]But as concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
\[32]I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
\[33]And when the multitude heard [this], they were astonished at his doctrine.
\[34]But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were assembled about him.
\[35]Then one of them [who was] a lawyer, asked [him a question], tempting him, and saying,
\[36]Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?
\[37]Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
\[38]This is the first and great commandment.
\[39]And the second [is] like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
\[40]On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
\[41]While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,
\[42]Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, [The son] of David.
\[43]He saith to them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
\[44]The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool?
\[45]If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
\[46]And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any [man], from that day forth, ask him any more questions.

\[2]Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat.
\[3]All therefore, whatever they bid you observe, [that] observe and do: but do not ye according to their works: for they say, and do not.
\[4]For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay [them] on men's shoulders; but they [themselves] will not move them with one of their fingers.
\[5]But all their works they do to be seen by men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
\[6]And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
\[7]And greetings in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
\[8]But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, [even] Christ; and all ye are brethren.
\[9]And call no [man] your father upon the earth: for one is your Father who is in heaven.
\[10]Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, [even] Christ.
\[11]But he that is greatest among you, shall be your servant.
\[12]And whoever shall exalt himself, shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself, shall be exalted.
\[13]But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in [yourselves], neither suffer ye them that are entering, to go in.
\[14]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
\[15]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell than yourselves.
\[16]Woe to you, [ye] blind guides, who say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
\[17][Ye] fools, and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
\[18]And whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
\[19][Ye] fools, and blind: for which [is] greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
\[20]Whoever therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things upon it.
\[21]And whoever shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth in it.
\[22]And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth upon it.
\[23]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier [matters] of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ye ought to have done, and not to leave the others undone.
\[24][Ye] blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel.
\[25]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
\[26][Thou] blind Pharisee, cleanse first that [which is] within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
\[27]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whitened sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead [men's] bones, and of all uncleanness.
\[28]Thus ye also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
\[29]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous,
\[30]And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
\[31]Wherefore ye are witnesses to yourselves, that ye are the children of them who killed the prophets.
\[32]Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
\[33][Ye] serpents, [ye] generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
\[34]Wherefore behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and [some] of them ye will kill and crucify, and [some] of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute [them] from city to city:
\[35]That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
\[36]Verily I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.
\[37]O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [thou] that killest the prophets, and stonest them who are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under [her] wings, and ye would not!
\[38]Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\[39]For I say to you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

nd Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to [him] to show him the buildings of the temple.
\[2]And Jesus said to them, See ye not all these things? verily I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
\[3]And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? and what [will be] the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
\[4]And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
\[5]For many will come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and will deceive many.
\[6]And ye will hear of wars, and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all [these things] must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
\[7]For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there will be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places.
\[8]All these [are] the beginning of sorrows.
\[9]Then will they deliver you up to be afflicted, and will kill you: and ye will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
\[10]And then will many be offended, and will betray one another, and will hate one another.
\[11]And many false prophets will rise, and will deceive many.
\[12]And because iniquity will abound, the love of many will become cold.
\[13]But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.
\[14]And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a testimony to all nations; and then shall the end come.
\[15]When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever readeth, let him understand,)
\[16]Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains:
\[17]Let him who is on the house-top not come down to take any thing out of his house:
\[18]Neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes.
\[19]And woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants in those days!
\[20]But pray ye that your flight may not be in the winter, neither on the sabbath:
\[21]For then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
\[22]And except those days should be shortened, there would no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.
\[23]Then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ, or there; believe [it] not.
\[24]For false Christs will arise, and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders; so that, if [it were] possible, they would deceive the very elect.
\[25]Behold, I have told you before.
\[26]Wherefore, if they shall say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, [he is] in the secret chambers; believe [it] not.
\[27]For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\[28]For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be collected.
\[29]Immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
\[30]And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\[31]And he will send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
\[32]Now learn a parable of the fig-tree; When its branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer [is] nigh:
\[33]So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, [even at] the doors.
\[34]Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things shall be fulfilled.
\[35]Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
\[36]But of that day and hour knoweth no [man], no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
\[37]But as the days of Noah [were], so will also the coming of the Son of man be.
\[38]For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
\[39]And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away: so also will be the coming of the Son of man.
\[40]Then will two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\[41]Two [women will be] grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\[42]Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord cometh.
\[43]But know this, that if the master of the house knew in what watch the thief would come, he would watch, and would not suffer his house to be broken up.
\[44]Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh.
\[45]Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season?
\[46]Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.
\[47]Verily I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all his goods.
\[48]But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming;
\[49]And shall begin to beat [his] fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
\[50]The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for [him], and in an hour that he is not aware of,
\[51]And will cut him asunder, and appoint [him] his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

hen shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
\[2]And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.
\[3]They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
\[4]But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
\[5]While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
\[6]And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
\[7]Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
\[8]And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil: for our lamps are gone out.
\[9]But the wise answered, saying, [Not so]; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
\[10]And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.
\[11]Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
\[12]But he answered and said, Verily I say to you, I know you not.
\[13]Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man cometh.
\[14]For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man traveling into a far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.
\[15]And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and forthwith took his journey.
\[16]Then he that had received the five talents, went and traded with the same, and gained other five talents.
\[17]And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained other two.
\[18]But he that had received one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
\[19]After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
\[20]And he that had received five talents, came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst to me five talents: behold, I have gained besides them five talents more.
\[21]His lord said to him, Well done [thou] good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
\[22]He also that had received two talents came, and said, Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents besides them.
\[23]His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
\[24]Then he who had received the one talent came, and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed:
\[25]And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, [there] thou hast [what is] thine.
\[26]His lord answered and said to him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not strewed:
\[27]Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received my own with interest.
\[28]Take therefore the talent from him, and give [it] to him who hath ten talents.
\[29]For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
\[30]And cast ye the unprofitable servant into utter darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\[31]When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then will he sit upon the throne of his glory:
\[32]And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats:
\[33]And he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
\[34]Then will the King say to them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
\[35]For I was hungry, and ye gave me food: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
\[36]Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.
\[37]Then will the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed [thee]? or thirsty, and gave [thee] drink?
\[38]When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in? or naked, and clothed [thee]?
\[39]Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?
\[40]And the king will answer and say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done [it] to me.
\[41]Then will he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
\[42]For I was hungry, and ye gave me no food: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
\[43]I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
\[44]Then will they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
\[45]Then will he answer them, saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it] not to me.
\[46]And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

nd it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,
\[2]Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
\[3]Then assembled the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
\[4]And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill [him].
\[5]But they said, Not on the feast-[day], lest there be an uproar among the people.
\[6]Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
\[7]There came to him a woman having an alabaster-box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he sat [at table].
\[8]But when his disciples saw [it], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?
\[9]For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
\[10]When Jesus understood [it], he said to them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
\[11]For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
\[12]For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial.
\[13]Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, which this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
\[14]Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
\[15]And said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
\[16]And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
\[17]Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
\[18]And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
\[19]And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
\[20]Now when the evening was come, he sat down with the twelve.
\[21]And as they were eating, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you will betray me.
\[22]And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?
\[23]And he answered and said, He that dippeth [his] hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.
\[24]The Son of man goeth, as it is written concerning him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man, if he had not been born.
\[25]Then Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said to him, Thou hast said.
\[26]And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed [it], and broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
\[27]And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
\[28]For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sin.
\[29]But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
\[30]And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
\[31]Then saith Jesus to them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
\[32]But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
\[33]Peter answered and said to him, Though all [men] shall be offended because of thee, [yet] will I never be offended.
\[34]Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that this night, before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.
\[35]Peter said to him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
\[36]Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.
\[37]And he took with him Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
\[38]Then saith he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
\[39]And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou [wilt].
\[40]And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
\[41]Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.
\[42]He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
\[43]And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
\[44]And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
\[45]Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\[46]Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
\[47]And while he was yet speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\[48]Now he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast.
\[49]And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail Master; and kissed him.
\[50]And Jesus said to him, Friend, Why art thou come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
\[51]And behold, one of them, who were with Jesus, stretched out [his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and smote off his ear.
\[52]Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.
\[53]Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
\[54]But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
\[55]In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staffs to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
\[56]But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
\[57]And they that had laid hold on Jesus, led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
\[58]But Peter followed him at a distance, to the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants to see the end.
\[59]Now the chief priests and elders, and all the council, sought false testimony against Jesus, to put him to death;
\[60]But found none: and, though many false witnesses came, [yet] found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
\[61]And said, This [man] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
\[62]And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answerest thou nothing, what [is it which] these testify against thee?
\[63]But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ the Son of God.
\[64]Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
\[65]Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
\[66]What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
\[67]Then they spit in his face, and buffetted him; and others smote [him] with the palms of their hands,
\[68]Saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
\[69]Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
\[70]But he denied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
\[71]And when he had gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, and said to them that were there, This [man] was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
\[72]And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
\[73]And after a while came to [him] they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy speech betrayeth thee.
\[74]Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not the man. And immediately the cock crowed.
\[75]And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him, Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

hen the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
\[2]And when they had bound him, they led [him] away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
\[3]Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
\[4]Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What [is that] to us? see thou [to that].
\[5]And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
\[6]And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
\[7]And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
\[8]Wherefore that field has been called, The field of blood, to this day.
\[9]Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
\[10]And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
\[11]And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.
\[12]And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
\[13]Then saith Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they testify against thee?
\[14]And he answered him to not a word; so that the governor marveled greatly.
\[15]Now at [that] feast, the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.
\[16]And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
\[17]Therefore when they were assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?
\[18](For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.)
\[19]When he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream, because of him.
\[20]But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
\[21]The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release to you? They said, Barabbas.
\[22]Pilate saith to them, What shall I do then with Jesus, who is called Christ? [They] all say to him, Let him be crucified.
\[23]And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
\[24]When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but [that] rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed [his] hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye [to it].
\[25]Then answered all the people, and said, His blood [be] on us, and on our children.
\[26]Then he released Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered [him] to be crucified.
\[27]Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band [of soldiers].
\[28]And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
\[29]And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put [it] upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews?
\[30]And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head.
\[31]And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify [him].
\[32]And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they constrained to bear his cross.
\[33]And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
\[34]They gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall: and when he had tasted [of it], he would not drink.
\[35]And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.
\[36]And sitting down, they watched him there:
\[37]And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[38]Then were there two thieves crucified with him: one on the right hand, and another on the left.
\[39]And they that passed by, reviled him, wagging their heads,
\[40]And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days, save thyself. If thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
\[41]Likewise also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,
\[42]He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
\[43]He trusted in God; let him deliver him now if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
\[44]The thieves also who were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
\[45]Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land to the ninth hour.
\[46]And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
\[47]Some of them that stood there, when they heard [that], said, This [man] calleth for Elijah.
\[48]And immediately one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled [it] with vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink.
\[49]The rest said, Forbear, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.
\[50]Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, expired.
\[51]And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom: and the earth shook, and the rocks rent;
\[52]And the graves were opened, and many bodies of saints who slept, arose,
\[53]And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.
\[54]Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
\[55]And many women were there (beholding at a distance) who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:
\[56]Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
\[57]When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.
\[58]He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
\[59]And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\[60]And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed.
\[61]And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulcher.
\[62]Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,
\[63]Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
\[64]Command therefore that the sepulcher be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error will be worse than the first.
\[65]Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, make [it] as secure as ye can.
\[66]So they went, and having sealed the stone, made the sepulcher secure with a watch.

n the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.
\[2]And behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
\[3]His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
\[4]And for fear of him the keepers trembled and became as dead [men].
\[5]And the angel answered and said to the women, Fear ye not: for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified.
\[6]He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
\[7]And go quickly, and tell his disciples, that he is risen from the dead, and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
\[8]And they departed quickly from the sepulcher, with fear and great joy; and ran to bring word to his disciples.
\[9]And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came, and held him by the feet, and worshiped him.
\[10]Then said Jesus to them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
\[11]Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that had been done.
\[12]And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
\[13]Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] while we slept.
\[14]And if this shall come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
\[15]So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
\[16]Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
\[17]And when they saw him, they worshiped him: but some doubted.
\[18]And Jesus came, and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and upon earth.
\[19]Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
\[20]Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, [even] to the end of the world. Amen.

he beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God;
\[2]As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee;
\[3]The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\[4]John was baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins.
\[5]And there went out to him all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
\[6]And John was clothed with camels hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey;
\[7]And preached, saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
\[8]I indeed have baptized you with water: but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
\[9]And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan.
\[10]And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.
\[11]And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\[12]And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
\[13]And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan: and was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.
\[14]Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
\[15]And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
\[16]Now as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
\[17]And Jesus said to them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
\[18]And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him.
\[19]And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.
\[20]And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
\[21]And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught.
\[22]And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
\[23]And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
\[24]Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
\[25]And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
\[26]And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
\[27]And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
\[28]And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region around Galilee.
\[29]And forthwith, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
\[30]But the mother of Simon's wife lay sick with a fever; and forthwith they tell him of her.
\[31]And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.
\[32]And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons.
\[33]And all the city was gathered at the door.
\[34]And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
\[35]And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
\[36]And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.
\[37]And when they had found him, they said to him, All [men] seek for thee.
\[38]And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for, for this purpose have I come.
\[39]And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.
\[40]And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\[41]And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith to him, I will; be thou clean.
\[42]And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
\[43]And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
\[44]And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
\[45]But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.

nd again he entered into Capernaum, after [some] days; and it was understood that he was in the house.
\[2]And forthwith many were assembled, so that there was no room to receive [them], no not so much as about the door: and he preached the word to them.
\[3]And they come to him, bringing one sick with the palsy, who was borne by four.
\[4]And when they could not come nigh to him by reason of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they let down the bed on which the sick with the palsy lay.
\[5]When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick with the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
\[6]But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
\[7]Why doth this [man] thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
\[8]And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
\[9]Which is easier, to say to the sick with the palsy, [Thy] sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
\[10]But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he saith to the sick with the palsy,
\[11]I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
\[12]And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
\[13]And he went forth again by the sea-[side]; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.
\[14]And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
\[15]And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at table in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and they followed him.
\[16]And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners.
\[17]When Jesus heard [it], he saith to them, They that are in health, have no need of a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.
\[18]And the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees, used to fast: and they come, and say to him, Why do the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
\[19]And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
\[20]But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.
\[21]No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up, taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
\[22]And no man putteth new wine into old bottles, else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
\[23]And it came to pass, that he went through the corn-fields on the sabbath; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
\[24]And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful?
\[25]And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he and they that were with him?
\[26]How he went into the house of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show-bread, which it is not lawful to eat, but for the priests, and gave also to them who were with him?
\[27]And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
\[28]Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

nd he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
\[2]And they watched him, [to see] whether he would heal him on the sabbath; that they might accuse him.
\[3]And he saith to the man who had the withered hand, Stand forth.
\[4]And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? but they held their peace.
\[5]And when he had looked around on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\[6]And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
\[7]But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea.
\[8]And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and [from] beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him.
\[9]And he spoke to his disciples, that a small boat should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
\[10]For he had healed many; so that they pressed upon him to touch him, as many as had diseases.
\[11]And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
\[12]And he strictly charged them, that they should not make him known.
\[13]And he goeth up upon a mountain, and calleth [to him] whom he would: and they came to him.
\[14]And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
\[15]And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons.
\[16]And Simon he surnamed Peter.
\[17]And James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, (and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder,)
\[18]And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
\[19]And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him: and they went into a house.
\[20]And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
\[21]And when his friends heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
\[22]And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the demons he casteth out demons.
\[23]And he called them [to him], and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
\[24]And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
\[25]And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
\[26]And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
\[27]No man can enter into a strong man's house, and seize his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.
\[28]Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and any blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme:
\[29]But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never hath forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:
\[30]Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
\[31]There came then his brethren and his mother, and standing without, they sent to him, calling him.
\[32]And the multitude sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brethren without seek for thee.
\[33]And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
\[34]And he looked around on them who sat about him, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
\[35]For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

nd he began again to teach by the sea-side: and there was gathered to him a great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat on the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea, on the land.
\[2]And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine,
\[3]Hearken; Behold, a sower went out to sow:
\[4]And it came to pass as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it.
\[5]And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth.
\[6]But when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
\[7]And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
\[8]And other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up, and increased, and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred.
\[9]And he said to them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\[10]And when he was alone, they that were about him, with the twelve, asked of him the parable.
\[11]And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all [these] things are done in parables:
\[12]That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.
\[13]And he said to them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
\[14]The sower soweth the word.
\[15]And these are they by the way-side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
\[16]And these are they likewise who are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
\[17]And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they relapse.
\[18]And these are they who are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
\[19]And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
\[20]And these are they who are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive [it], and bring forth fruit, some thirty-fold, some sixty, and some a hundred.
\[21]And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a close vessel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
\[22]For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither hath any thing been kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
\[23]If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\[24]And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear: With the measure which ye give, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given.
\[25]For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
\[26]And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
\[27]And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
\[28]For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
\[29]But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
\[30]And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
\[31][It is] like a grain of mustard-seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.
\[32]But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under its shade.
\[33]And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear [it].
\[34]But without a parable he spoke not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
\[35]And the same day, when the evening was come, he saith to them, Let us pass over to the other side.
\[36]And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other small boats.
\[37]And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full.
\[38]And he was in the hinder part of the boat, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
\[39]And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still: and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
\[40]And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
\[41]And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

nd they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
\[2]And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
\[3]Who had [his] dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
\[4]For he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any [man] tame him.
\[5]And always, night and day, he was on the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
\[6]But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped him,
\[7]And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
\[8](For he said to him, Come out of the man, [thou] unclean spirit.)
\[9]And he asked him, What [is] thy name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion: for we are many.
\[10]And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
\[11]Now there was there nigh to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
\[12]And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
\[13]And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.
\[14]And they that fed the swine fled, and told [it] in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
\[15]And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the demon, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
\[16]And they that saw [it] told them how it befell him that was possessed with the demon, and [also] concerning the swine.
\[17]And they began to pray him to depart out of their borders.
\[18]And when he had come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the demon prayed him that he might be with him.
\[19]Yet Jesus suffered him not, but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
\[20]And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him. And all [men] wondered.
\[21]And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side, much people gathered to him: and he was nigh to the sea.
\[22]And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
\[23]And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: [I pray thee], come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she will live.
\[24]And [Jesus] went with him; and many people followed him, and thronged him.
\[25]And a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years,
\[26]And had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not relieved, but rather grew worse,
\[27]When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.
\[28]For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
\[29]And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that infirmity.
\[30]And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the throng, and said, Who touched my clothes?
\[31]And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
\[32]And he looked around, to see her that had done this thing.
\[33]But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
\[34]And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be healed of thy infirmity.
\[35]While he was yet speaking, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's [house certain] who said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
\[36]As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe,
\[37]And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
\[38]And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
\[39]And when he had come in, he saith to them, Why make ye this tumult, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
\[40]And they derided him: but when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
\[41]And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi: which is, being interpreted, Damsel (I say to thee) arise.
\[42]And forthwith the damsel arose, and walked; for she was [of the age] of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
\[43]And he charged them strictly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.

nd he went out from thence, and came into his own country, and his disciples follow him.
\[2]And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing [him] were astonished, saying, From whence hath this [man] these things? and what wisdom [is] this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
\[3]Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
\[4]But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house.
\[5]And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick persons, and healed [them].
\[6]And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages teaching.
\[7]And he calleth [to him] the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
\[8]And commanded them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, save a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in [their] purse:
\[9]But [be] shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
\[10]And he said to them, In whatever place ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
\[11]And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
\[12]And they went out and preached that men should repent.
\[13]And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed [them].
\[14]And king Herod heard [of him] (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist had risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
\[15]Others said, That it is Elijah. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
\[16]But when Herod heard [of him], he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he hath risen from the dead.
\[17]For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
\[18]For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
\[19]Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
\[20]For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and observed him: and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
\[21]And when a convenient day had come, that Herod on his birth-day made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief [men] of Galilee;
\[22]And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod, and them that sat with him, the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give [it] thee.
\[23]And he swore to her, Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give [it] thee, to the half of my kingdom.
\[24]And she went forth, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? and she said, The head of John the Baptist.
\[25]And she came in forthwith with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou shouldst give me, immediately, in a dish, the head of John the Baptist.
\[26]And the king was exceeding sorry: [yet] for his oath's sake, and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not reject her.
\[27]And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
\[28]And brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
\[29]And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
\[30]And the apostles assembled themselves to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
\[31]And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
\[32]And they departed into a desert place in a boat privately.
\[33]And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran on foot thither out of all cities, and out went them, and came together to him.
\[34]And Jesus, when he came out, saw many people, and was moved with compassion towards them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
\[35]And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time [is] far passed:
\[36]Send them away, that they may go into the country around, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
\[37]He answered and said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
\[38]He saith to them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
\[39]And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
\[40]And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
\[41]And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes he divided among them all.
\[42]And they all ate, and were satisfied.
\[43]And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
\[44]And they that ate of the loaves, were about five thousand men.
\[45]And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the boat, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
\[46]And when he had dismissed them, he departed to a mountain to pray.
\[47]And when evening was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
\[48]And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
\[49]But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out.
\[50](For they all saw him, and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and saith to them, Be of good cheer: It is I; be not afraid.
\[51]And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
\[52]For they considered not [the miracle] of the loaves; for their heart was hardened.
\[53]And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
\[54]And when they had come out of the boat forthwith they knew him,
\[55]And ran through that whole region around, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
\[56]And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch, if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him, were healed.

hen came together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem.
\[2]And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled (that is to say with unwashed) hands, they found fault.
\[3]For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands often eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
\[4]And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there are, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, and of brazen vessels, and tables.
\[5]Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
\[6]He answered and said to them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.
\[7]But, in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.
\[8]For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
\[9]And he said to them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition,
\[10]For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Whoever curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
\[11]But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shall be free].
\[12]And ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother;
\[13]Making the word of God of no effect through your traditions, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.
\[14]And when he had called all the people [to him], he said to them, Hearken to me every one [of you], and understand.
\[15]There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him, can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
\[16]If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\[17]And when he had entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
\[18]And he saith to them, Are ye so void of understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatever thing from without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him.
\[19]Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all kinds of food.
\[20]And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
\[21]For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
\[22]Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness;
\[23]All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
\[24]And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.
\[25]For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
\[26](The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation,) and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
\[27]But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be satisfied: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] to the dogs.
\[28]And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crums.
\[29]And he said to her, For this saying, depart; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.
\[30]And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
\[31]And again, departing from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
\[32]And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
\[33]And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue.
\[34]And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith to him, Effatha, that is, Be opened.
\[35]And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.
\[36]And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them; so much the more a great deal they published [it];
\[37]And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

n those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples, and saith to them,
\[2]I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
\[3]And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for some of them came from a distance.
\[4]And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?
\[5]And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
\[6]And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before [them]; and they set [them] before the people.
\[7]And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them].
\[8]So they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments that were left, seven baskets.
\[9]And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he dismissed them.
\[10]And forthwith he entered into a boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
\[11]And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
\[12]And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek for a sign? Verily I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.
\[13]And he left them, and entering into the boat again, departed to the other side.
\[14]Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf.
\[15]And he charged them saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod.
\[16]And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.
\[17]And when Jesus knew [it], he saith to them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
\[18]Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
\[19]When I divided the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.
\[20]And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
\[21]And he said to them, How is it that ye do not understand?
\[22]And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and besought him to touch him.
\[23]And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught.
\[24]And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees walking.
\[25]After that, he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
\[26]And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.
\[27]And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Cesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?
\[28]And they answered, John the Baptist: but some [say], Elijah; and others, One of the prophets,
\[29]And he saith to them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith to him, Thou art the Christ.
\[30]And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
\[31]And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
\[32]And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
\[33]But when he had turned about, and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.
\[34]And when he had called the people [to him] with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
\[35]For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
\[36]For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul:
\[37]Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
\[38]Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also will the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

\[2]And after six days, Jesus taketh [with him] Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up upon a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them.
\[3]And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.
\[4]And there appeared to them Elijah, with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
\[5]And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
\[6]For he knew not what to say: for they were greatly terrified.
\[7]And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
\[8]And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
\[9]And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
\[10]And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
\[11]And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
\[12]And he answered and told them, Elijah verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written concerning the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at naught.
\[13]But I say to you, that Elijah is indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they pleased, as it is written concerning him.
\[14]And when he came to [his] disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
\[15]And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to [him], saluted him.
\[16]And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
\[17]And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;
\[18]And wherever he taketh him, he teareth him; and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not.
\[19]He answered him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you, how long shall I suffer you? bring him to me.
\[20]And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed, foaming.
\[21]And he asked his father, How long is it since this came to him? and he said, From a child.
\[22]And often it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
\[23]Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things [are] possible to him that believeth.
\[24]And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.
\[25]When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, [Thou] dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
\[26]And [the spirit] cried, and rent him severely, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; so that many said, He is dead.
\[27]But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
\[28]And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
\[29]And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
\[30]And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know [it].
\[31]For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and after that he is killed, he will rise the third day.
\[32]But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
\[33]And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house, he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
\[34]But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who [should be] the greatest.
\[35]And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith to them, If any man desireth to be first, [the same] shall be last of all, and servant of all.
\[36]And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them,
\[37]Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
\[38]And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
\[39]But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
\[40]For he that is not against us, is on our part.
\[41]For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
\[42]And whoever shall cause one of [these] little ones that believe in me, to fall into sin, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
\[43]And if thy hand causeth thee to fall into sin, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
\[44]Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
\[45]And if thy foot causeth thee to fall into sin, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
\[46]Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
\[47]And if thy eye causeth thee to fall into sin, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into hell-fire.
\[48]Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
\[49]For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
\[50]Salt [is] good: but if the salt hath lost its saltness, with what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

nd he arose from thence, and cometh into the borders of Judea, by the further side of Jordan: and the people resort to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again.
\[2]And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife? tempting him.
\[3]And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?
\[4]And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put [her] away.
\[5]And Jesus answered and said to them, For the hardness of your heart, he wrote you this precept.
\[6]But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.
\[7]For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
\[8]And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.
\[9]What therefore God hath joined together, let not man separate.
\[10]And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same [matter].
\[11]And he saith to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
\[12]And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.
\[13]And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them; and [his] disciples rebuked those that brought [them].
\[14]But when Jesus saw [it], he was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
\[15]Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child, he shall not enter it.
\[16]And he took them up in his arms, put [his] hands upon them, and blessed them.
\[17]And when he had gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
\[18]And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good, but one, [that is] God.
\[19]Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and mother.
\[20]And he answered and said to him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
\[21]Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
\[22]And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
\[23]And Jesus looked around, and saith to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
\[24]And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
\[25]It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\[26]And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
\[27]And Jesus looking upon them, saith, With men [it is] impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
\[28]Then Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
\[29]Jesus answered and said, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
\[30]But he shall receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come, eternal life.
\[31]But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last first.
\[32]And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,
\[33][Saying], Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles;
\[34]And they will mock him, and will scourge him, and will spit upon him, and will kill him: and the third day he will rise again.
\[35]And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire.
\[36]And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you?
\[37]They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
\[38]But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
\[39]And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of: and with the baptism that I am baptized with shalt ye be baptized;
\[40]But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
\[41]And when the ten heard [it], they began to be much displeased with James and John.
\[42]But Jesus called them, and saith to them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
\[43]But so it shall not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
\[44]And whoever of you will be the chief, shall be servant of all.
\[45]For even the son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
\[46]And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples, and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the highway-side begging.
\[47]And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, [thou] son of David, have mercy on me.
\[48]And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, [Thou] son of David, have mercy on me.
\[49]And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called: and they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
\[50]And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
\[51]And Jesus answered and said to him, What wilt thou that I should do to thee? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
\[52]And Jesus said to him, Go, thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

nd when they came nigh to Jerusalem, to Bethphage, and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
\[2]And saith to them, Go into the village over against you: and as soon as ye have entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, on which never man sat; loose him, and bring [him].
\[3]And if any man shall say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and immediately he will send him hither.
\[4]And they went, and found the colt tied by the door without, in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
\[5]And certain of them that stood there, said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
\[6]And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded; and they let them go.
\[7]And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
\[8]And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off trees, and strewed [them] in the way.
\[9]And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna: Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\[10]Blessed [be] the kingdom of our Father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
\[11]And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round upon all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany, with the twelve.
\[12]And on the morrow, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry,
\[13]And seeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves: for the time of figs had not yet come.
\[14]And Jesus answered and said to it, Let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard [it].
\[15]And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
\[16]And would not suffer that any man should carry [any] vessel through the temple.
\[17]And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called by all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
\[18]And the scribes and chief priests heard [it], and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his doctrine.
\[19]And when evening had come, he went out of the city.
\[20]And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots.
\[21]And Peter calling to remembrance, saith to him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered.
\[22]And Jesus answering, saith to them, Have faith in God.
\[23]For verily I say to you, that whoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that the things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he saith.
\[24]Therefore I say to you, Whatever things ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive [them], and ye shall have [them].
\[25]And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any: that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
\[26]But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
\[27]And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
\[28]And say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
\[29]And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\[30]The baptism of John, was [it] from heaven, or from men? answer me.
\[31]And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
\[32]But if we shall say, from men; they feared the people: for all [men] counted John that he was a prophet indeed.
\[33]And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

nd he began to speak to them by parables. A [certain] man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about [it], and digged [a place for] the wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
\[2]And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
\[3]And they caught [him], and beat him and sent [him] away empty.
\[4]And again, he sent to them another servant: and at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head, and sent [him] away shamefully handled.
\[5]And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
\[6]Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son.
\[7]But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
\[8]And they took him, and killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.
\[9]What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.
\[10]And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
\[11]This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
\[12]And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people; for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and departed.
\[13]And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees, and of the Herodians, to catch him in [his] words.
\[14]And when they had come, they say to him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?
\[15]Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it].
\[16]And they brought [it]: and he saith to them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said to him, Cesar's.
\[17]And Jesus answering, said to them, Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they wondered at him.
\[18]Then come to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
\[19]Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother shall die, and leave [his] wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise seed to his brother.
\[20]Now there were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
\[21]And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
\[22]And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
\[23]In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her for a wife.
\[24]And Jesus answering, said to them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
\[25]For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels who are in heaven.
\[26]And concerning the dead that they rise; have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
\[27]He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
\[28]And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
\[29]And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord.
\[30]And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.
\[31]And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: there is no other commandment greater than these.
\[32]And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is no other but he.
\[33]And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
\[34]And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
\[35]And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?
\[36]For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
\[37]David therefore himself calleth him Lord, and whence is he [then] his son? and the common people heard him gladly.
\[38]And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations in the market-places,
\[39]And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
\[40]Who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
\[41]And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
\[42]And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
\[43]And he called his disciples, and saith to them, Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more, than all they who have cast into the treasury.
\[44]For all [they] cast in of their abundance: but she of her want cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.

nd as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to him, Master, see what manner of stones, and what buildings [are here]!
\[2]And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
\[3]And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, asked him privately,
\[4]Tell us, when will these things be? and what [will be] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
\[5]And Jesus answering them, began to say, Take heed lest any [man] deceive you:
\[6]For many will come in my name, saying, I am [Christ]; and will deceive many.
\[7]And when ye shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars, be ye not troubled: for [such things] must needs be; but the end [will] not [be] yet.
\[8]For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there will be earthquakes in [divers] places, and there will be famines, and troubles: these [are] the beginnings of sorrows.
\[9]But take heed to yourselves: for they will deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye will be beaten: and ye will be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
\[10]And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
\[11]But when they shall lead [you], and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
\[12]Now the brother will betray the brother to death, and the father the son: and children will rise up against [their] parents, and will cause them to be put to death.
\[13]And ye will be hated by all [men] for my name's sake: but he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.
\[14]But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand) then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains:
\[15]And let him that is on the house-top not go down into the house, neither enter [it], to take any thing out of his house:
\[16]And let him that is in the field not turn back again to take up his garment.
\[17]But woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants in those days.
\[18]And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
\[19]For [in] those days shall be affliction, such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall be.
\[20]And except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
\[21]And then, if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ; or lo, [he is] there; believe [him] not.
\[22]For false Christs, and false prophets will rise, and will show signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect.
\[23]But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
\[24]But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
\[25]And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
\[26]And then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
\[27]And then he will send his angels, and will assemble his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
\[28]Now learn a parable of the fig-tree: When its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
\[29]So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, [even] at the doors.
\[30]Verily I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things shall be done.
\[31]Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
\[32]But of that day and [that] hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
\[33]Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
\[34][For the son of man is] as a man taking a long journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work; and commanded the porter to watch.
\[35]Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:
\[36]Lest coming suddenly, he should find you sleeping.

\[2]But they said, Not on the feast-[day], lest there should be an uproar of the people.
\[3]And being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard, very precious; and she broke the box, and poured [it] on his head.
\[4]And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
\[5]For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
\[6]And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
\[7]For ye have the poor with you always, and whenever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
\[8]She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
\[9]Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, [this] also that she hath done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her.
\[10]And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.
\[11]And when they heard [it], they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
\[12]And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover?
\[13]And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
\[14]And wherever he shall go in, say ye to the master of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?
\[15]And he will show you a large upper room furnished [and] prepared: there make ready for us.
\[16]And his disciples went, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.
\[17]And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
\[18]And as they sat, and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say to you, One of you who eateth with me, will betray me.
\[19]And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, [Is] it I? and another [said], [Is] it I?
\[20]And he answered and said to them, [It is] one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish.
\[21]The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written concerning him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
\[22]And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke [it], and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
\[23]And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave [it] to them: and they all drank of it.
\[24]And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
\[25]Verily I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
\[26]And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.
\[27]And Jesus saith to them, All ye will be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
\[28]But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
\[29]But Peter said to him, Although all shall be offended, yet [will] not I.
\[30]And Jesus saith to him, Verily I say to thee, that this day, [even] in this night, before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice.
\[31]But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
\[32]And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
\[33]And he taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and to be very heavy;
\[34]And saith to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful to death: tarry ye here, and watch.
\[35]And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, If it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
\[36]And he said, Abba, Father, all things [are] possible to thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt.
\[37]And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldst not thou watch one hour?
\[38]Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly [is] ready, but the flesh [is] weak.
\[39]And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words.
\[40]And when he returned, he found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy:) neither knew they what to answer him.
\[41]And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\[42]Rise, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
\[43]And immediately while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders.
\[44]And he that betrayed him, had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away safely.
\[45]And as soon as he was come, he goeth immediately to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
\[46]And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
\[47]And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
\[48]And Jesus answered and said to them, Have ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and [with] staffs to take me?
\[49]I was daily with you in the temple, teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
\[50]And they all forsook him, and fled.
\[51]And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about [his] naked [body]; and the young men laid hold on him.
\[52]And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
\[53]And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders and the scribes.
\[54]And Peter followed him at a distance, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
\[55]And the chief priests, and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
\[56]For many bore false testimony against him, but their testimony agreed not together.
\[57]And there arose certain, and bore false testimony against him, saying,
\[58]We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
\[59]But neither so did their testimony agree together.
\[60]And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these testify against thee?
\[61]But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
\[62]And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
\[63]Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
\[64]Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
\[65]And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.
\[66]And as Peter was below in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
\[67]And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
\[68]But he denied, saying, I know not, neither do I understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crowed.
\[69]And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is [one] of them.
\[70]And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art [one] of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth [thereto].
\[71]But he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not this man of whom ye speak.
\[72]And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him, Before the cock shall crow twice, thou wilt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

nd forthwith in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.
\[2]And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering, said to him, Thou sayest [it].
\[3]And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
\[4]And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they testify against thee.
\[5]But Jesus yet answered nothing: so that Pilate marveled.
\[6]Now at [that] feast he released to them one prisoner, whom they desired.
\[7]And there was [one] named Barabbas, [who lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
\[8]And the multitude crying aloud, began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done to them.
\[9]But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews?
\[10](For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.)
\[11]But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
\[12]And Pilate answered, and said again to them, What will ye then that I shall do [to him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?
\[13]And they cried out again, Crucify him.
\[14]Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
\[15]And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
\[16]And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Pretorium; and they call together the whole band;
\[17]And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],
\[18]And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
\[19]And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees, worshiped him.
\[20]And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
\[21]And they constrain one Simon, a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
\[22]And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
\[23]And they gave him to drink, wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.
\[24]And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
\[25]And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
\[26]And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[27]And with him they crucify two thieves, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
\[28]And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
\[29]And they that passed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,
\[30]Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
\[31]Likewise also the chief priests mocking, said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others, himself he cannot save.
\[32]Let Christ the king of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him.
\[33]And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land, until the ninth hour.
\[34]And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama, sabacthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
\[35]And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.
\[36]And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.
\[37]And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and expired.
\[38]And the vail of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.
\[39]And when the centurion who stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and expired, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
\[40]There were also women looking on at a distance, among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger, and of Joses, and Salome;
\[41]Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and many other women who came with him to Jerusalem.
\[42]And now, when the evening was come, (because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath)
\[43]Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
\[44]And Pilate wondered if he was already dead: and calling the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
\[45]And when he knew [it] from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
\[46]And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped [him] in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.
\[47]And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses, beheld where he was laid.

nd when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
\[2]And very early in the morning, the first [day] of the week, they came to the sepulcher at the rising of the sun:
\[3]And they said among themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the sepulcher?
\[4](And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away) for it was very great.
\[5]And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were frightened.
\[6]And he saith to them, Be not frightened: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him:
\[7]But go, tell his disciples and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.
\[8]And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled, and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any [man]; for they were afraid.
\[9]Now when [Jesus] was risen early, the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.
\[10][And] she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
\[11]And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, believed not.
\[12]After that, he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking and going into the country.
\[13]And they went and told [it] to the residue: neither believed they them.
\[14]Afterward he appeared to the eleven, as they sat at table, and upbraided them with their unbelief, and hardness of heart, because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen.
\[15]And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
\[16]He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
\[17]And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak in new languages;
\[18]They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
\[19]So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
\[20]And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

orasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
\[2]Even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the word;
\[3]It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
\[4]That thou mayest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed.
\[5]There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elisabeth.
\[6]And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
\[7]And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were far advanced in years.
\[8]And it came to pass, that, while he executed the priests' office before God in the order of his course,
\[9]According to the custom of the priests' office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
\[10]And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.
\[11]And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
\[12]And when Zacharias saw [him], he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
\[13]But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
\[14]And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
\[15]For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.
\[16]And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
\[17]And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
\[18]And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife far advanced in years.
\[19]And the angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.
\[20]And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season.
\[21]And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple.
\[22]And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.
\[23]And it came to pass, that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
\[24]And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and secluded herself five months, saying,
\[25]Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.
\[26]And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\[27]To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name [was] Mary.
\[28]And the angel came to her, and said, Hail, [thou that art] highly favored, the Lord [is] with thee: blessed [art] thou among women.
\[29]And when she saw [him], she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
\[30]And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.
\[31]And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
\[32]He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David.
\[33]And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.
\[34]Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
\[35]And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon thee, and the power of the Highest will overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
\[36]And behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren:
\[37]For with God nothing will be impossible.
\[38]And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
\[39]And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill-country with haste, into a city of Judah,
\[40]And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
\[41]And it came to pass, that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
\[42]And she spoke with a loud voice, and said, Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb.
\[43]And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\[44]For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
\[45]And blessed [is] she that believed that there will be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
\[46]And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
\[47]And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.
\[48]For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold, from henceforth all generations will call me blessed.
\[49]For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy [is] his name.
\[50]And his mercy [is] on them that fear him, from generation to generation.
\[51]He hath shown strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
\[52]He hath put down the mighty from [their] seats, and exalted them of low degree.
\[53]He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent away empty.
\[54]He hath sustained his servant Israel, in remembrance of [his] mercy;
\[55]As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
\[56]And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
\[57]Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
\[58]And her neighbors and her cousins heard that the Lord had shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
\[59]And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
\[60]And his mother answered and said, Not [so]; but he shall be called John.
\[61]And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
\[62]And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
\[63]And he asked for a writing-table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all wondered.
\[64]And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed], and he spoke, and praised God.
\[65]And fear came on all that dwelt around them; and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill-country of Judea.
\[66]And all they that had heard [them], laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child will this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
\[67]And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
\[68]Blessed [be] the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people.
\[69]And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant David:
\[70]As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began:
\[71]That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
\[72]To perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant:
\[73]The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,
\[74]That he would grant to us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,
\[75]In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
\[76]And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
\[77]To give knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins,
\[78]Through the tender mercy of our God; by which the day-spring from on high hath visited us,
\[79]To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shades of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
\[80]And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.

nd it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
\[2]([And] this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
\[3]And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
\[4]And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David)
\[5]To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
\[6]And so it was, that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
\[7]And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
\[8]And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
\[9]And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were in great fear.
\[10]And the angel said to them, Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people.
\[11]For to you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
\[12]And this [shall be] a sign to you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger.
\[13]And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
\[14]Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men.
\[15]And it came to pass, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.
\[16]And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
\[17]And when they had seen [it], they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.
\[18]And all they that heard [it], wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
\[19]But Mary kept all these things, and pondered [them] in her heart.
\[20]And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them.
\[21]And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so named by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\[22]And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present [him] to the Lord;
\[23](As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that is the first born of his mother shall be called holy to the Lord)
\[24]And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.
\[25]And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name [was] Simeon; and the same man [was] just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
\[26]And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
\[27]And he came by the spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
\[28]Then he took him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
\[29]Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
\[30]For my eyes have seen thy salvation,
\[31]Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
\[32]A light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
\[33]And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken concerning him.
\[34]And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
\[35](And a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
\[36]And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;
\[37]And she [was] a widow of about eighty four years, who departed not from the temple, but served [God] with fastings and prayers night and day.
\[38]And she coming in that instant, gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
\[39]And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
\[40]And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
\[41]Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
\[42]And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.
\[43]And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not [of it].
\[44]But they, supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among [their] relations and acquaintance.
\[45]And when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.
\[46]And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
\[47]And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
\[48]And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
\[49]And he said to them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be about my Father's business?
\[50]And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.
\[51]And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
\[52]And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.

ow in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanius the tetrarch of Abilene,
\[2]Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
\[3]And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins;
\[4]As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\[5]Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways [shall be] made smooth;
\[6]And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
\[7]Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\[8]Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
\[9]And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\[10]And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
\[11]He answereth and saith to them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath provisions, let him do likewise.
\[12]Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said to him, Master, what shall we do?
\[13]And he said to them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
\[14]And the soldiers likewise asked him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse [any] falsely, and be content with your wages.
\[15]And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, whether he was the Christ, or not;
\[16]John answered, saying to [them] all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:
\[17]Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
\[18]And many other things in his exhortation he preached to the people.
\[19]But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
\[20]Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
\[21]Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

nd Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
\[2]Being forty days tempted by the devil. And in those days he ate nothing; and when they were ended, he was afterward hungry.
\[3]And the devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
\[4]And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
\[5]And the devil taking him up upon a high mountain, showed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
\[6]And the devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will, I give it.
\[7]If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
\[8]And Jesus answered and said to him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
\[9]And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the son of God, cast thyself down from hence.
\[10]For it is written, He will give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:
\[11]And in [their] hands they will bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\[12]And Jesus answering, said to him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\[13]And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
\[14]And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the surrounding region.
\[15]And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
\[16]And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath, and stood up to read.
\[17]And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
\[18]The spirit of the Lord [is] upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
\[19]To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
\[20]And he closed the book, and he gave [it] again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
\[21]And he began to say to them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
\[22]And all bore him testimony, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
\[23]And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
\[24]And he said, Verily I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
\[25]But I tell you in truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land:
\[26]But to none of them was Elijah sent, save to Sarepta, [a city] of Sidon, to a woman [that was] a widow.
\[27]And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.
\[28]And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
\[29]And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
\[30]But he passing through the midst of them, went away,
\[31]And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath-days.
\[32]And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
\[33]And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,
\[34]Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
\[35]And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.
\[36]And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word [is] this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
\[37]And the fame of him went out into every place of the surrounding country.
\[38]And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And the mother of Simon's wife was taken with a violent fever; and they besought him for her.
\[39]And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered to them.
\[40]Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases, brought them to him: and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
\[41]And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking [them], suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
\[42]And when it was day, he departed, and went into a desert place; and the people sought him, and came to him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
\[43]And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also, for therefore am I sent.
\[44]And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

nd it came to pass, that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret.
\[2]And saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing [their] nets.
\[3]And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the boat.
\[4]Now when he had left speaking, he said to Simon, Lanch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
\[5]And Simon answering said to him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing; nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net.
\[6]And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.
\[7]And they beckoned to [their] partners, who were in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
\[8]When Simon Peter saw [it], he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
\[9]For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
\[10]And so [was] also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
\[11]And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
\[12]And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell on [his] face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
\[13]And he put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: Be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
\[14]And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.
\[15]But so much the more a fame of him went abroad: and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
\[16]And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
\[17]And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.
\[18]And behold, men brought in a bed a man who was taken with the palsy: and they sought [means] to bring him in, and to lay [him] before him.
\[19]And when they could not find by what [way] they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went upon the house-top, and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch, into the midst before Jesus.
\[20]And when he saw their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
\[21]And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
\[22]But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering, said to them, What reason ye in your hearts?
\[23]Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Rise and walk?
\[24]But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, He said to the sick with the palsy, I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thy house.
\[25]And immediately he arose before them, and took up that on which he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
\[26]And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.
\[27]And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me.
\[28]And he left all, arose, and followed him.
\[29]And Levi made him a great feast in his own house; and there was a great company of publicans, and of others that sat down with them.
\[30]But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
\[31]And Jesus answering, said to them, They that are well need not a physician; but they that are sick.
\[32]I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\[33]And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
\[34]And he said to them, Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
\[35]But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.
\[36]And he spoke also a parable to them: No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old: if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new, agreeth not with the old.
\[37]And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles will perish.
\[38]But new wine must be put into new bottles, and both are preserved.
\[39]No man also having drank old [wine], immediately desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.

nd it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through corn-fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and ate, rubbing [them] in [their] hands.
\[2]And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?
\[3]And Jesus answering them, said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry, and they who were with him;
\[4]How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the show-bread, and gave also to them that were with him, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
\[5]And he said to them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
\[6]And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue, and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered:
\[7]And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, [to see] whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him.
\[8]But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose, and stood forth.
\[9]Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath-days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy [it]?
\[10]And looking around upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\[11]And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
\[12]And it came to pass in those days, that he went out to a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
\[13]And when it was day, he called [to him] his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named Apostles;
\[14]Simon (whom he also named Peter) and Andrew his brother, James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
\[15]Matthew and Thomas, James the [son] of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes,
\[16]And Judas [the brother] of James, and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.
\[17]And he came down with them, and stood in the plain; and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
\[18]And they that were afflicted with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
\[19]And the whole multitude sought to touch him; for there went virtue out of him, and healed [them] all.
\[20]And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed [are ye] poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
\[21]Blessed [are] ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed [are ye] that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
\[22]Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you [from their company], and shall reproach [you], and cast out your name as evil, on account of the son of man.
\[23]Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward [is] great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers to the prophets.
\[24]But woe to you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
\[25]Woe to you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
\[26]Woe to you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
\[27]But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,
\[28]Bless them that curse you, and pray for them who despitefully use you.
\[29]And to him that smiteth thee on the [one] cheek, offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not [to take thy] coat also.
\[30]Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask [them] not again.
\[31]And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
\[32]For if ye love them who love you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.
\[33]And if ye do good to them who do good to you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also do even the same.
\[34]And if ye lend [to them] from whom ye hope to receive, what thanks have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much in return.
\[35]But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and [to] the evil.
\[36]Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
\[37]Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:
\[38]Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye give [to others], it shall be measured to you again.
\[39]And he spoke a parable to them; Can the blind lead the blind? will they not both fall into the ditch?
\[40]The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect, shall be as his master.
\[41]And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye?
\[42]Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thy eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.
\[43]For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
\[44]For every tree is known by its own fruit: for from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush do they gather grapes.
\[45]A good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: for from the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
\[46]And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
\[47]Whoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like.
\[48]He is like a man who built a house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
\[49]But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that, without a foundation, built a house on the earth, against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.

ow when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
\[2]And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.
\[3]And when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
\[4]And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
\[5]For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
\[6]Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof;
\[7]Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
\[8]For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].
\[9]When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned himself about and said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\[10]And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well that had been sick.
\[11]And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain: and many of his disciples went with him, and many people.
\[12]Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her.
\[13]And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Weep not.
\[14]And he came and touched the bier: And they that bore [him] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.
\[15]And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak, and he delivered him to his mother.
\[16]And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet hath risen among us; and, That God hath visited his people.
\[17]And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all the neighboring region.
\[18]And the disciples of John informed him of all these things.
\[19]And John calling two of his disciples sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
\[20]When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
\[21]And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities, and diseases, and of evil spirits; and to many [that were] blind he gave sight.
\[22]Then Jesus answering, said to them, Go, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.
\[23]And blessed is [he], to whom I shall not be a stumbling block.
\[24]And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
\[25]But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they who are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.
\[26]But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
\[27]This is [he], concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
\[28]For I say to you, Among those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.
\[29]And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
\[30]But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him.
\[31]And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
\[32]They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.
\[33]For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.
\[34]The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.
\[35]But wisdom is justified by all her children.
\[36]And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down at table.
\[37]And behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that [Jesus] sat at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster-box of ointment,
\[38]And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment.
\[39]Now when the Pharisee who had invited him, saw [it], he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who, and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him, for she is a sinner.
\[40]And Jesus answering, said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, speak.
\[41]There was a certain creditor, who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
\[42]And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
\[43]Simon answered and said, I suppose that [he], to whom he forgave most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.
\[44]And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head.
\[45]Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
\[46]My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
\[47]Wherefore I say to thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little.
\[48]And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.
\[49]And they that sat at table with him, began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
\[50]And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

nd it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve [were] with him,
\[2]And certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons.
\[3]And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance.
\[4]And when many people were collected, and had come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:
\[5]A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
\[6]And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered, because it lacked moisture.
\[7]And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
\[8]And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundred-fold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
\[9]And his disciples asked him, saying, What doth this parable mean?
\[10]And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
\[11]Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
\[12]Those by the way side, are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
\[13]They on the rock [are they], who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
\[14]And that which fell among thorns are they, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
\[15]But that on the good ground are they, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep [it], and bring forth fruit with patience.
\[16]No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth [it] under a bed; but setteth [it] on a candlestick, that they who enter in may see the light.
\[17]For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither [any thing] hid, that shall not be known, and come abroad.
\[18]Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whoever hath, to him shall be given; and whoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.
\[19]Then came to him [his] mother and his brethren, and could not come near to him for the crowd.
\[20]And it was told to him [by certain], who said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
\[21]And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God, and do it.
\[22]Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they lanched forth.
\[23]But as they sailed, he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled [with water], and were in jeopardy.
\[24]And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\[25]And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid, wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
\[26]And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
\[27]And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, who had demons a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs.
\[28]When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God most high? I beseech thee torment me not.
\[29](For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had caught him, and he was kept bound with chains, and in fetters: and he broke the bands, and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.)
\[30]And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many demons had entered into him.
\[31]And they besought him, that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
\[32]And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.
\[33]Then the demons went out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
\[34]When they that fed [them] saw what was done, they fled, and went and told [it] in the city and in the country.
\[35]Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
\[36]They also who saw [it], told them by what means he that was possessed by the demons was healed.
\[37]Then the whole multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes, besought him to depart from them: for they were taken with great fear. And he went into the boat, and returned.
\[38]Now the man out of whom the demons had departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,
\[39]Return to thy own house, and show how great things God hath done to thee. And he went away and published throughout the whole city, how great things Jesus had done to him.
\[40]And it came to pass, that, when Jesus had returned, the people [gladly] received him: for they were all waiting for him.
\[41]And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him that he would come into his house:
\[42]For he had one daughter only, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. (But as he was going, the people thronged him.
\[43]And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed by any,
\[44]Came behind [him], and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
\[45]And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter, and they that were with him, said, Master, the multitude throng thee, and press [thee], and sayest thou, Who touched me?
\[46]And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue hath gone out of me.
\[47]And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
\[48]And he said to her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
\[49]While he was yet speaking, there cometh one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead: trouble not the Master.
\[50]But when Jesus heard [it], he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be healed.
\[51]And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
\[52]And all wept and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not: she is not dead, but sleepeth.
\[53]And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.
\[54]And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
\[55]And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately: and he commanded to give her food.
\[56]And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

hen he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
\[2]And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
\[3]And he said to them, Take nothing for [your] journey, neither staffs, nor bag, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.
\[4]And into whatever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.
\[5]And whoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
\[6]And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
\[7]Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John had risen from the dead;
\[8]And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets had risen again.
\[9]And Herod said, John have I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
\[10]And the apostles, when they had returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place, belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
\[11]And the people, when they knew [it], followed him: and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.
\[12]And when the day began to decline, then came the twelve, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country around, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
\[13]But he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy provisions for all this people.
\[14]For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
\[15]And they did so, and made them all sit down.
\[16]Then he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
\[17]And they ate, and were all satisfied: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them, twelve baskets.
\[18]And it came to pass, as he was in retirement praying, his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying, Who say the people that I am?
\[19]They answering, said, John the Baptist; but some [say], Elijah; and others [say], that one of the ancient prophets is risen again.
\[20]He said to them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answering, said, Christ of God.
\[21]And he strictly charged them, and commanded [them] to tell no man that thing,
\[22]Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised the third day.
\[23]And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
\[24]For whoever will save his life, shall lose it: but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
\[25]For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
\[26]For whoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and [in that of his] Father, and of the holy angels.
\[27]But I tell you in truth, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.
\[28]And it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter, and John, and James, and went up upon a mountain to pray.
\[29]And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment [was] white [and] glistening.
\[30]And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah.
\[31]Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
\[32]But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
\[33]And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.
\[34]While he was thus speaking, there came a cloud and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
\[35]And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
\[36]And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept [it] close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
\[37]And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the hill, many people met him.
\[38]And behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee look upon my son: for he is my only child.
\[39]And lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and bruising him, hardly departeth from him.
\[40]And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
\[41]And Jesus answering, said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.
\[42]And as he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and tore [him]. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
\[43]And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all wondering at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
\[44]Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men.
\[45]But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him concerning that saying.
\[46]Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
\[47]And Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
\[48]And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; and whoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
\[49]And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.
\[50]And Jesus said to him, Forbid [him] not: for he that is not against us, is for us.
\[51]And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
\[52]And sent messengers before his face: and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
\[53]And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
\[54]And when his disciples James and John saw [this], they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did?
\[55]But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
\[56]For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save [them]. And they went to another village.
\[57]And it came to pass, that as they were going in the way, a certain [man] said to him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
\[58]And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.
\[59]And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\[60]Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
\[61]And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go [and] bid them farewell who are at my house.
\[62]And Jesus said to him, No man having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

fter these things, the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city, and place, whither he himself would come.
\[2]Therefore said he to them, The harvest truly [is] great, but the laborers [are] few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.
\[3]Go: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
\[4]Carry neither purse, nor sack, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.
\[5]And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace [be] to this house.
\[6]And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.
\[7]And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
\[8]And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.
\[9]And heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come nigh to you.
\[10]But into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of the same, and say,
\[11]Even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding, be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh to you.
\[12]But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
\[13]Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\[14]But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.
\[15]And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.
\[16]He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.
\[17]And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through thy name.
\[18]And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
\[19]Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
\[20]Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
\[21]In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.
\[22]All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and [he] to whom the Son will reveal [him].
\[23]And he turned himself to [his] disciples, and said privately, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that ye see.
\[24]For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen [them]; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard [them].
\[25]And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\[26]He said to him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
\[27]And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.
\[28]And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
\[29]But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
\[30]And Jesus answering said, A certain [man] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped him of his raiment, and wounded [him], and departed, leaving [him] half dead.
\[31]And by chance there came down a certain priest that way; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\[32]And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked [on him], and passed by on the other side.
\[33]But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came were he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion [on him],
\[34]And went to [him], and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\[35]And on the morrow, when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave [them] to the host, and said to him, Take care of him: and whatever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.
\[36]Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers?
\[37]And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou likewise.
\[38]Now it came to pass, as they were going, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house.
\[39]And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.
\[40]But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
\[41]And Jesus answered, and said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious, and troubled about many things:
\[42]But one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

nd it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
\[2]And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
\[3]Give us day by day our daily bread.
\[4]And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
\[5]And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves:
\[6]For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
\[7]And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
\[8]I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.
\[9]And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you.
\[10]For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door shall be opened.
\[11]If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if [he shall ask] a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
\[12]Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
\[13]If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
\[14]And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it came to pass when the demon was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.
\[15]But some of them said, He casteth out demons through Beelzebub, the chief of the demons.
\[16]And others tempting [him], sought from him a sign from heaven.
\[17]But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falleth.
\[18]If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.
\[19]And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast [them] out? therefore shall they be your judges.
\[20]But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
\[21]When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
\[22]But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armor in which he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
\[23]He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
\[24]When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest: and finding none, he saith, I will return to my house whence I came out.
\[25]And when he cometh, he findeth [it] swept and garnished.
\[26]Then he goeth and taketh [to him] seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first.
\[27]And it came to pass, as he was speaking these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed [is] the womb that bore thee, and the paps which nourished thee.
\[28]But he said, Yes, rather blessed [are] they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
\[29]And when the people were assembled in crowds, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
\[30]For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also shall the Son of man be to this generation.
\[31]The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here.
\[32]The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah [is] here.
\[33]No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth [it] in a secret place, neither under a close vessel, but on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.
\[34]The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thy eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when [thy eye] is evil, thy body also [is] full of darkness.
\[35]Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee be not darkness.
\[36]If thy whole body therefore [be] full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light; as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.
\[37]And as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to eat.
\[38]And when the Pharisee saw [it], he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner.
\[39]And the Lord said to him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
\[40][Ye] fools, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within also?
\[41]But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and behold, all things are clean to you.
\[42]But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint, and rue, and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others undone.
\[43]Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
\[44]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over [them] are not aware [of them].
\[45]Then answered one of the lawyers, and said to him, Master, thus saying, thou reproachest us also.
\[46]And he said, Woe to you also, [ye] lawyers, for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
\[47]Woe to you! for ye build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\[48]Truly ye bear testimony, that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchers.
\[49]Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they will slay and persecute:
\[50]That the blood of all the prophets, which hath been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
\[51]From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.
\[52]Woe to you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye have not entered in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
\[53]And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge [him] vehemently, and to solicit him to speak of many things;
\[54]Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something from his mouth, that they might accuse him.

n the mean time, when there was gathered an innumerable multitude of people, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
\[2]For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
\[3]Therefore, whatever ye have spoken in darkness, shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops.
\[4]And I say to you, my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
\[5]But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, Fear him.
\[6]Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
\[7]But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
\[8]Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.
\[9]But he that denieth me before men, shall be denied before the angels of God.
\[10]And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.
\[11]And when they bring you to the synagogues, and [before] magistrates, and powers, be not solicitous how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:
\[12]For the Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
\[13]And one of the company said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
\[14]And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge, or a divider over you?
\[15]And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
\[16]And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
\[17]And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to deposit my fruits?
\[18]And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I deposit all my fruits and my goods.
\[19]And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast abundance of goods laid up for many years; take thy ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry.
\[20]But God said to him, [Thou] fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?
\[21]So [is] he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God.
\[22]And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.
\[23]The life is more than food, and the body [is more] than raiment.
\[24]Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap: which neither have store-house, nor barn; and God feedeth them: How much more are ye better than the fowls?
\[25]And which of you by solicitude can add to his stature one cubit?
\[26]If ye then are not able to do that thing which is least, why are ye anxious for the rest?
\[27]Consider the lilies how they grow: They toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\[28]If then God so clothe the grass, which is to-day in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more [will he clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
\[29]And seek ye not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
\[30]For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
\[31]But rather seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.
\[32]Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
\[33]Sell what ye have, and give alms: provide yourselves bags which become not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
\[34]For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\[35]Let your loins be girt, and [your] lights burning;
\[36]And ye yourselves like men that wait for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately.
\[37]Blessed [are] those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say to you, that he will gird himself, and make them to sit down to eat, and will come forth and serve them.
\[38]And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find [them] so, blessed are those servants.
\[39]And this know, that if the master of the house knew at what hour the thief would come, he would watch, and not suffer his house to be broken through.
\[40]Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
\[41]Then Peter said to him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or even to all?
\[42]And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom [his] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give [them their] portion of provisions in due season?
\[43]Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
\[44]In truth I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.
\[45]But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the men-servants, and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken?
\[46]The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for [him], and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him asunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
\[47]And that servant who knew his lord's will, and prepared not [himself], neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many [stripes].
\[48]But he that knew not, and committed things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes]. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom men have committed much, from him they will ask the more.
\[49]I am come to send fire on the earth, and what will I, if it is already kindled?
\[50]But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it shall be accomplished!
\[51]Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, No; but rather division:
\[52]For from henceforth there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
\[53]The father will be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\[54]And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, immediately ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.
\[55]And when [ye perceive] the south wind blowing, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.
\[56][Ye] hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky, and of the earth; but how is it, that ye do not discern this time?
\[57]And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
\[58]When thou goest with thy adversary to the magistrate, [as thou art] in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he draw thee before the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
\[59]I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.

here were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
\[2]And Jesus answering, said to them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
\[3]I tell you, No; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\[4]Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
\[5]I tell you, No; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\[6]He spoke also this parable: A certain [man] had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.
\[7]Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
\[8]And he answering, said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung [it]:
\[9]And if it shall bear fruit, [well]: and if not, [then] after that thou shalt cut it down.
\[10]And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
\[11]And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise raise [herself].
\[12]And when Jesus saw her, he called [her to him], and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thy infirmity.
\[13]And he laid [his] hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
\[14]And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said to the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath.
\[15]The Lord then answered him, and said, [Thou] hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or [his] ass from the stall, and lead [him] away to watering?
\[16]And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?
\[17]And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
\[18]Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I resemble it?
\[19]It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden, and it grew, and became a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
\[20]And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
\[21]It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
\[22]And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying towards Jerusalem.
\[23]Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said to them,
\[24]Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
\[25]When once the master of the house hath risen, and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he will answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are:
\[26]Then ye will begin to say, We have eaten and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
\[27]But he will say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are: depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity.
\[28]There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you [yourselves] excluded.
\[29]And they will come from the east, and [from] the west, and from the north, and [from] the south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God.
\[30]And behold, there are last, who shall be first; and there are first who shall be last.
\[31]The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Go out, and depart hence; for Herod will kill thee.
\[32]And he said to them, Go ye and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third [day] I shall be perfected.
\[33]Nevertheless, I must walk to-day and to-morrow, and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.
\[34]O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee; how often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen [gathereth] her brood under [her] wings, and ye would not!
\[35]Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And verily I say to you, ye shall not see me, until [the time shall] come when ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

nd it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath, that they watched him.
\[2]And behold, there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy.
\[3]And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?
\[4]And they held their peace. And he took [him] and healed him, and let him go;
\[5]And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not forthwith pull him out on the sabbath?
\[6]And they could not answer him again to these things.
\[7]And he put forth a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying to them,
\[8]When thou art invited by any [man] to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room, lest a more honorable man than thou be invited by him;
\[9]And he that invited thee and him, shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
\[10]But when thou art invited, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honor in the presence of them that sit at table with thee.
\[11]For whoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
\[12]Then said he also to him that invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor [thy] rich neighbors; lest they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made thee.
\[13]But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
\[14]And thou shalt be blessed: for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
\[15]And when one of them that sat at table with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed [is] he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
\[16]Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many:
\[17]And sent his servant at supper-time, to say to them that were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.
\[18]And they all with one [consent] began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
\[19]And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.
\[20]And another said, I have married a wife: and therefore I cannot come.
\[21]So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
\[22]And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
\[23]And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel [them] to come in, that my house may be filled.
\[24]For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited, shall taste my supper.
\[25]And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said to them,
\[26]If any [man] cometh to me, and hateth not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
\[27]And whoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
\[28]For which of you intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he hath [sufficient] to finish [it]?
\[29]Lest perhaps after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish [it], all that behold [it] begin to mock him,
\[30]Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
\[31]Or what king going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
\[32]Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an embassy, and desireth conditions of peace.
\[33]So likewise, whoever he is of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
\[34]Salt [is] good: but if the salt hath lost its savor, with what shall it be seasoned?
\[35]It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill, [but] men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

hen drew near to him all the publicans and sinners to hear him.
\[2]And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
\[3]And he spoke this parable to them, saying,
\[4]What man of you having a hundred sheep, if he loseth one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he findeth it?
\[5]And when he hath found [it], he layeth [it] on his shoulders, rejoicing.
\[6]And when he cometh home, he calleth together [his] friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
\[7]I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, who need no repentance.
\[8]Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she loseth one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she findeth [it]?
\[9]And when she hath found [it], she calleth [her] friends and [her] neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
\[10]Likewise, I say to you, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
\[11]And he said, A certain man had two sons:
\[12]And the younger of them said to [his] father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth [to me]. And he divided to them [his] living.
\[13]And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
\[14]And when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
\[15]And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
\[16]And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat; and no man gave to him.
\[17]And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!
\[18]I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
\[19]And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
\[20]And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
\[21]And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
\[22]But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet:
\[23]And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill [it]; and let us eat, and be merry:
\[24]For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
\[25]Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
\[26]And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
\[27]And he said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him in health.
\[28]And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore his father came out, and entreated him.
\[29]And he answering, said to [his] father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither have I at any time transgressed thy commandment; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
\[30]But as soon as this thy son had come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
\[31]And he said to him, Son, thou art ever with me: and all that I have is thine.
\[32]It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

nd he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.
\[2]And he called him, and said to him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for thou mayest be no longer steward.
\[3]Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.
\[4]I am resolved what to do, that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
\[5]So he called every one of his lord's debtors, and said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?
\[6]And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
\[7]Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty.
\[8]And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
\[9]And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
\[10]He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much.
\[11]If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true [riches]?
\[12]And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give you that which is your own?
\[13]No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
\[14]And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things, and they derided him.
\[15]And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.
\[16]The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
\[17]And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than one tittle of the law to fail.
\[18]Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whoever marrieth her that is put away from [her] husband, committeth adultery.
\[19]There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
\[20]And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores,
\[21]And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.
\[22]And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried:
\[23]And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
\[24]And he cried, and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.
\[25]But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
\[26]And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from thence.
\[27]Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house:
\[28]For I have five brethren; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
\[29]Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
\[30]And he said, No, father Abraham: but if one shall go to them from the dead, they will repent.
\[31]And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one shall rise from the dead.

hen he said to the disciples, It is impossible but that causes of sin will come: but woe [to him] by whom they come!
\[2]It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.
\[3]Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother shall trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he shall repent forgive him.
\[4]And if he shall trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day shall turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
\[5]And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.
\[6]And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this sycamine-tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
\[7]But which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him immediately, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to eat?
\[8]And will not rather say to him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drank; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
\[9]Doth he thank that servant, because he did the things that were commanded him? I suppose not.
\[10]So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all the things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which it was our duty to do.
\[11]And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
\[12]And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood at a distance.
\[13]And they lifted up [their] voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
\[14]And when he saw [them], he said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that as they were going, they were cleansed.
\[15]And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
\[16]And fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
\[17]And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine?
\[18]There are not found returning to give glory to God, save this stranger.
\[19]And he said to him, Arise, depart: thy faith hath made thee whole.
\[20]And when he was asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.
\[21]Neither will they say, Lo here! or lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
\[22]And he said to his disciples, The days will come, when ye will desire to see one of the days of the son of man, and ye shall not see [it].
\[23]And they will say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them], nor follow them.
\[24]For as the lightning that lighteneth from the one [part] under heaven, shineth to the other [part] under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.
\[25]But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.
\[26]And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
\[27]They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
\[28]Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
\[29]But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed [them] all:
\[30]Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
\[31]In that day, he who shall be upon the house-top, and his furniture in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
\[32]Remember Lot's wife.
\[33]Whoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life, shall preserve it.
\[34]I tell you, in that night there will be two [men] in one bed; the one will be taken, and the other will be left.
\[35]Two [women] will be grinding together; the one will be taken, and the other left.
\[36]Two [men] will be in the field; the one will be taken, and the other left.

nd he spoke a parable to them [to this end], that men ought always [to] pray, and not to faint;
\[2]Saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, neither regarded man.
\[3]And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.
\[4]And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
\[5]Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
\[6]And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
\[7]And will not God avenge his own elect, who cry day and night to him, though he beareth long with them?
\[8]I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith on the earth?
\[9]And he spoke this parable to certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
\[10]Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
\[11]The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
\[12]I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
\[13]And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
\[14]I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
\[15]And they brought to him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.
\[16]But Jesus called them [to him], and said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
\[17]Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter into it.
\[18]And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\[19]And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good?  none [is] good, save one, [that is] God.
\[20]Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and thy mother.
\[21]And he said, All these have I kept from my youth.
\[22]Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
\[23]And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
\[24]And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly will they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
\[25]For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\[26]And they that heard [it], said, Who then can be saved?
\[27]Then he said, The things which are impossible with men, are possible with God.
\[28]Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
\[29]And he said to them, Verily I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,
\[30]Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
\[31]Then he took the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
\[32]For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, and spitefully treated, and spitted on;
\[33]And they will scourge [him], and put him to death: and the third day he will rise again.
\[34]And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
\[35]And it came to pass, that as he had come nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging;
\[36]And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what it meant.
\[37]And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
\[38]And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] son of David, have mercy on me.
\[39]And they who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] son of David, have mercy on me.
\[40]And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he had come near, he asked him,
\[41]Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
\[42]And Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
\[43]And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise to God.

nd [Jesus] entered and passed through Jericho.
\[2]And behold, [there was] a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.
\[3]And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.
\[4]And he ran before, and climbed up upon a sycamore-tree to see him; for he was to pass that [way].
\[5]And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste, and come down: for to-day I must abide at thy house.
\[6]And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
\[7]And when they saw [it], they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
\[8]And Zaccheus stood, and said to the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore [him] four-fold.
\[9]And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
\[10]For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
\[11]And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.
\[12]He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
\[13]And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said to them, Occupy till I come.
\[14]But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this [man] to reign over us.
\[15]And it came to pass, that when he had returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
\[16]Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
\[17]And he said to him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.
\[18]And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.
\[19]And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
\[20]And another came, saying, Lord, behold, [here is] thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:
\[21]For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.
\[22]And he saith to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, [thou] wicked servant. Thou knewest me to be an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow:
\[23]Why then gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?
\[24]And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give [it] to him that hath ten pounds.
\[25](And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)
\[26]For I say to you, That to every one who hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away from him.
\[27]But those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay [them] before me.
\[28]And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending towards Jerusalem.
\[29]And it came to pass, when he had come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
\[30]Saying, Go ye into the village over against [you]; in which at your entering ye will find a colt tied, on which yet never man sat: loose him, and bring [him hither].
\[31]And if any man shall ask you, Why do ye loose [him]? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord hath need of him.
\[32]And they that were sent, went and found even as he had said to them.
\[33]And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why loose ye the colt?
\[34]And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
\[35]And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus upon him.
\[36]And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
\[37]And when he had come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had seen.
\[38]Saying, Blessed [be] the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
\[39]And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
\[40]And he answered and said to them, I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
\[41]And when he had come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
\[42]Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things [which belong] to thy peace! but now they are hid from thy eyes.
\[43]For the days shall come upon thee, that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and encompass thee, and keep thee in on every side,
\[44]And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee: and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
\[45]And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought,
\[46]Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.
\[47]And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
\[48]And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.

nd it came to pass, [that] on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon [him], with the elders,
\[2]And spoke to him, saying, Tell us, By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
\[3]And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:
\[4]The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?
\[5]And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
\[6]But if we say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
\[7]And they answered, that they could not tell whence [it was].
\[8]And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
\[9]Then he began to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.
\[10]And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent [him] away empty.
\[11]And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated [him] shamefully, and sent [him] away empty.
\[12]And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also, and cast [him] out.
\[13]Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be when they see him they will reverence him.
\[14]But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
\[15]So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed [him]. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
\[16]He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard [it], they said, may that never be.
\[17]And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
\[18]Whoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
\[19]And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
\[20]And they watched [him], and sent forth spies, who should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.
\[21]And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person [of any], but teachest the way of God truly:
\[22]Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar, or not?
\[23]But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why tempt ye me?
\[24]Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Cesar's.
\[25]And he said to them, Render therefore to Cesar the things which are Cesar's, and to God the things which are God's.
\[26]And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.
\[27]Then came to [him] certain of the Sadducees (who deny that there is any resurrection) and they asked him,
\[28]Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If any man's brother should die, having a wife, and he should die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
\[29]There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
\[30]And the second took her for a wife, and he died childless.
\[31]And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: And they left no children, and died.
\[32]Last of all the woman died also.
\[33]Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
\[34]And Jesus answering, said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
\[35]But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
\[36]Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
\[37]Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
\[38]For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.
\[39]Then certain of the scribes answering, said, Master, thou hast well said.
\[40]And after that, they durst not ask him any question at all.
\[41]And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David's son?
\[42]And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
\[43]Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
\[44]David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
\[45]Then in the audience of all the people, he said to his disciples,
\[46]Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
\[47]Who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.

nd he looked up, and saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
\[2]And he saw also a certain poor widow, casting in thither two mites.
\[3]And he said, Of a truth I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all.
\[4]For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
\[5]And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones, and gifts, he said,
\[6][As for] these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.
\[7]And they asked him, saying, Master, but when will these things be? and what sign [will there be] when these things shall come to pass?
\[8]And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many will come in my name, saying, I am [Christ]; and the time draweth near: therefore go ye not after them.
\[9]But when ye shall hear of wars, and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass: but the end [is] not immediately.
\[10]Then said he to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
\[11]And great earthquakes will be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences: and fearful sights, and great signs will there be from heaven.
\[12]But before all these they will lay their hands on you, and persecute [you], delivering [you] up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.
\[13]And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
\[14]Settle [it] therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer.
\[15]For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
\[16]And ye will be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and [some] of you will they cause to be put to death.
\[17]And ye will be hated by all [men] for my name's sake.
\[18]But there shall not a hair of your head perish.
\[19]In your patience possess ye your souls.
\[20]And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that its desolation is nigh.
\[21]Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let them who are in the midst of it depart [from it]; and let not them that are in the countries enter into it.
\[22]For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
\[23]But woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
\[24]And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled.
\[25]And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
\[26]Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for apprehension of those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
\[27]And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory.
\[28]And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads: for your redemption draweth nigh.
\[29]And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees;
\[30]When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your ownselves that summer is now nigh at hand.
\[31]So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
\[32]Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
\[33]Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my word shall not pass away.
\[34]And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and [so] that day come upon you unawares.
\[35]For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
\[36]Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
\[37]And in the day-time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called [the mount] of Olives.

ow the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
\[2]And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him: for they feared the people.
\[3]Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
\[4]And he went, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.
\[5]And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
\[6]And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.
\[7]Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
\[8]And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the passover, that we may eat.
\[9]And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
\[10]And he said to them, Behold, when ye have entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth.
\[11]And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Master saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?
\[12]And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
\[13]And they went and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.
\[14]And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
\[15]And he said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.
\[16]For I say to you, I will not any more eat of it until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
\[17]And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide [it] among yourselves.
\[18]For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
\[19]And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke [it], and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
\[20]Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup [is] the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
\[21]But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me [is] with me on the table.
\[22]And truly the Son of man goeth as it was determined: but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!
\[23]And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
\[24]And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
\[25]And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them, are called benefactors.
\[26]But ye [shall] not [be] so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
\[27]For which [is] greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? [is] not he that sitteth at table? but I am among you as he that serveth.
\[28]Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations.
\[29]And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed to me;
\[30]That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\[31]And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired [to have] you, that he may sift [you] as wheat:
\[32]But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
\[33]And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both into prison, and to death.
\[34]And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, before thou wilt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
\[35]And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and sack, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
\[36]Then said he to them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take [it], and likewise [his] sack: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
\[37]For I say to you, that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
\[38]And they said, Lord, behold, here [are] two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.
\[39]And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
\[40]And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
\[41]And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed.
\[42]Saying, Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.
\[43]And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
\[44]And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.
\[45]And when he arose from prayer, and had come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow:
\[46]And said to them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
\[47]And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
\[48]But Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
\[49]When they who were about him, saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
\[50]And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
\[51]And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
\[52]Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, Are ye come out as against a thief, with swords and staffs?
\[53]When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
\[54]Then they took him, and led [him], and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance.
\[55]And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
\[56]But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
\[57]And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
\[58]And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
\[59]And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, In truth this [man] also was with him; for he is a Galilean.
\[60]And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crowed.
\[61]And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.
\[62]And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
\[63]And the men that held Jesus, mocked him, and smote [him].
\[64]And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
\[65]And many other things blasphemously they spoke against him.
\[66]And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief priests, and the scribes came together, and led him into their council,
\[67]Saying, Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe.
\[68]And if I also ask [you], ye will not answer me, nor let [me] go.
\[69]Hereafter will the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
\[70]Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.
\[71]And they said, What need have we of any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.

nd the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate.
\[2]And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [man] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, saying, that he himself is Christ a king.
\[3]And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest [it].
\[4]Then said Pilate to the chief priests, and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.
\[5]And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
\[6]When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
\[7]And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.
\[8]And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he had been for a long time, desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
\[9]Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
\[10]And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
\[11]And Herod with his troops set him at naught, and mocked [him], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
\[12]And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before they were at enmity between themselves.
\[13]And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people,
\[14]Said to them, Ye have brought this man to me, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man, touching those things of which ye accuse him;
\[15]No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and lo, nothing worthy of death is done to him:
\[16]I will therefore chastise him, and release [him].
\[17](For of necessity he must release one to them at the feast.)
\[18]And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release to us Barabbas:
\[19](Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
\[20]Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.
\[21]But they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
\[22]And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him; I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.
\[23]And they were urgent with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified: and the voices of them, and of the chief priests prevailed.
\[24]And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
\[25]And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
\[26]And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.
\[27]And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.
\[28]But Jesus turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
\[29]For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never nourished infants.
\[30]Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
\[31]For if they do these things in a green tree, what will be done in the dry?
\[32]And two others, [who were] malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.
\[33]And when they had come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors; one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
\[34]Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
\[35]And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ the chosen of God.
\[36]And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
\[37]And saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
\[38]And a superscription also was written over him, in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[39]And one of the malefactors, who were hanged, railed on him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.
\[40]But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
\[41]And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
\[42]And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
\[43]And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
\[44]And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
\[45]And the sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.
\[46]And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he expired.
\[47]Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
\[48]And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
\[49]And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off beholding these things.
\[50]And behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counselor: [and he was] a good man, and a just:
\[51](The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them) [he was] of Arimathea, a city of the Jews; who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
\[52]This [man] went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
\[53]And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, in which man was never before laid.
\[54]And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
\[55]And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.
\[56]And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.

ow upon the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them.
\[2]And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.
\[3]And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
\[4]And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed at this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.
\[5]And as they were afraid, and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
\[6]He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,
\[7]Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
\[8]And they remembered his words,
\[9]And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
\[10]It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were] with them, who told these things to the apostles.
\[11]And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
\[12]Then Peter arose, and ran to the sepulcher, and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.
\[13]And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] sixty furlongs.
\[14]And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
\[15]And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together], and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
\[16]But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.
\[17]And he said to them, What manner of communications [are] these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
\[18]And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said to him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?
\[19]And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God, and all the people:
\[20]And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
\[21]But we trusted that it had been he who would have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.
\[22]Yes, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulcher.
\[23]And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
\[24]And certain of them who were with us, went to the sepulcher, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
\[25]Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
\[26]Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?
\[27]And beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
\[28]And they drew nigh to the village whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.
\[29]But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
\[30]And it came to pass, as he sat at table with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and broke, and gave to them.
\[31]And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.
\[32]And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
\[33]And they rose the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled, and them that were with them,
\[34]Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
\[35]And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known to them in breaking of bread.
\[36]And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace [be] to you.
\[37]But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
\[38]And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
\[39]Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
\[40]And when he had thus spoken, he showed them [his] hands and [his] feet.
\[41]And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any thing for food?
\[42]And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honey-comb.
\[43]And he took [it], and ate before them.
\[44]And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me.
\[45]Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
\[46]And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
\[47]And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
\[48]And ye are witnesses of these things.
\[49]And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye are endued with power from on high.
\[50]And he led them out as far as to Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
\[51]And it came to pass, while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
\[52]And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
\[53]And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

n the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\[2]The same was in the beginning with God.
\[3]All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
\[4]In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
\[5]And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
\[6]There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.
\[7]The same came for a witness, to bear testimony of the Light, that all [men] through him might believe.
\[8]He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear testimony of that Light.
\[9][That] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
\[10]He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
\[11]He came to his own, and his own received him not.
\[12]But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:
\[13]Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\[14]And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
\[15]John testified concerning him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me, is preferred before me; for he was before me.
\[16]And of his fullness have we all received, and grace for grace.
\[17]For the law was given by Moses, [but] grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
\[18]No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].
\[19]And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who art thou?
\[20]And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
\[21]And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? and he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
\[22]Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
\[23]He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.
\[24]And they who were sent were of the Pharisees.
\[25]And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?
\[26]John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
\[27]He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes' latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
\[28]These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\[29]The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.
\[30]This is he of whom I said, after me cometh a man who is preferred before me; for he was before me.
\[31]And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
\[32]And John bore testimony, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
\[33]And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.
\[34]And I saw and bore testimony, that this is the Son of God.
\[35]Again the next day after, John stood, and two of his disciples;
\[36]And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
\[37]And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
\[38]Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master) where dwellest thou?
\[39]He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
\[40]One of the two who heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
\[41]He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah; which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
\[42]And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas; which is, by interpretation, a stone.
\[43]The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, follow me.
\[44]Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\[45]Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We have found him described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
\[46]And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see.
\[47]Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
\[48]Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.
\[49]Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
\[50]Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these.
\[51]And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

nd the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
\[2]And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
\[3]And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no wine.
\[4]Jesus saith to her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come.
\[5]His mother saith to the servants, Whatever he saith to you, do [it].
\[6]And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
\[7]Jesus saith to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the brim.
\[8]And he saith to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore [it].
\[9]When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was; (but the servants who drew the water knew) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
\[10]And saith to him, Every man at the beginning presenteth good wine; and when men have well drank, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.
\[11]This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
\[12]After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and they continued there not many days.
\[13]And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
\[14]And found in the temple those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money, sitting:
\[15]And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
\[16]And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence: make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.
\[17]And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.
\[18]Then answered the Jews, and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, seeing that thou doest these things?
\[19]Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
\[20]Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
\[21]But he spoke of the temple of his body.
\[22]When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.
\[23]Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he performed.
\[24]But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all [men].
\[25]And needed not that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.

here was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
\[2]The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
\[3]Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
\[4]Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
\[5]Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born of water, and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
\[6]That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.
\[7]Marvel not that I said to thee, Ye must be born again.
\[8]The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
\[9]Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?
\[10]Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?
\[11]Verily, verily, I say to thee, We speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and ye receive not our testimony.
\[12]If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?
\[13]And no man hath ascended to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man who is in heaven.
\[14]And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
\[15]That whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
\[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.
\[17]For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him may be saved.
\[18]He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
\[19]And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
\[20]For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
\[21]But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
\[22]After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
\[23]And John also was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
\[24]For John was not yet cast into prison.
\[25]Then there arose a question between [some] of John's disciples and the Jews, about purifying.
\[26]And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou didst bear testimony, behold, the same baptizeth, and all [men] come to him.
\[27]John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
\[28]Ye yourselves bear me testimony, that I said I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
\[29]He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
\[30]He must increase, but I [must] decrease.
\[31]He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
\[32]And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
\[33]He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.
\[34]For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for [to him] God giveth not the Spirit by measure.
\[35]The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
\[36]He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

hen therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
\[2](Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
\[3]He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
\[4]And he must needs go through Samaria.
\[5]Then he cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground, that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\[6]Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.
\[7]There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.
\[8](For his disciples had gone to the city to buy provisions.)
\[9]Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
\[10]Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.
\[11]The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
\[12]Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?
\[13]Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again:
\[14]But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
\[15]The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come hither to draw.
\[16]Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
\[17]The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
\[18]For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in that thou hast spoken truth.
\[19]The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
\[20]Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
\[21]Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
\[22]Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship, for salvation is from the Jews.
\[23]But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
\[24]God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him, must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.
\[25]The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh, who is called Christ; when he is come, he will tell us all things.
\[26]Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee am [he].
\[27]And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
\[28]The woman then left her waterpot, and went into the city, and saith to the men,
\[29]Come, see a man who hath told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
\[30]Then they went out of the city, and came to him.
\[31]In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
\[32]But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of.
\[33]Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him [aught] to eat?
\[34]Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
\[35]Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
\[36]And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.
\[37]And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
\[38]I sent you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye have entered into their labors.
\[39]And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that ever I did.
\[40]So when the Samaritans had come to him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
\[41]And many more believed, because of his own word;
\[42]And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.
\[43]Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
\[44]For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
\[45]Then when he had come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.
\[46]So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
\[47]When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
\[48]Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
\[49]The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down ere my child dieth.
\[50]Jesus saith to him, Go; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he departed.
\[51]And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him], saying, Thy son liveth.
\[52]Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend: and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
\[53]So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth: and he himself believed, and his whole house.
\[54]This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus performed, when he had come from Judea into Galilee.

fter this there was a feast of the Jews: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\[2]Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep [market] a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porches.
\[3]In these lay a great multitude of impotent persons, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
\[4]For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and agitated the water: whoever then first after the stirring of the water stepped in, was cured of whatever disease he had.
\[5]And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
\[6]When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith to him, Wilt thou be healed?
\[7]The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is agitated, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
\[8]Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
\[9]And immediately the man was healed, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
\[10]The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, it is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed.
\[11]He answered them, He that healed me, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
\[12]Then they asked him, What man is that who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
\[13]And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place.
\[14]Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art cured: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee.
\[15]The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.
\[16]And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.
\[17]But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
\[18]Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
\[19]Then answered Jesus, and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatever things he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
\[20]For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.
\[21]For as the Father raiseth the dead, and reviveth [them]; even so the Son reviveth whom he will.
\[22]For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment to the Son:
\[23]That all [men] should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father who hath sent him.
\[24]Verily, verily, I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but hath passed from death to life.
\[25]Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
\[26]For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
\[27]And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
\[28]Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
\[29]And shall come forth; they that have done good to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.
\[30]I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me.
\[31]If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.
\[32]There is another that testifieth concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he beareth concerning me is true.
\[33]Ye sent to John, and he testified to the truth.
\[34]But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye may be saved.
\[35]He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
\[36]But I have greater testimony than [that] of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear testimony concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.
\[37]And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath borne testimony concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
\[38]And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
\[39]Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
\[40]And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.
\[41]I receive not honor from men.
\[42]But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
\[43]I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
\[44]How can ye believe, who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that [cometh] from God only?
\[45]Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moses, in whom ye trust.
\[46]For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote concerning me.
\[47]But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

fter these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is [the sea] of Tiberias.
\[2]And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he performed on them that were diseased.
\[3]And Jesus went upon a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
\[4]And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
\[5]When Jesus then lifted up [his] eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?
\[6](And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.)
\[7]Philip answered him, Two hundred penny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them make take a little:
\[8]One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith to him,
\[9]There is a lad here, who hath five barley-loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
\[10]And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down in number about five thousand.
\[11]And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes, as much as they would.
\[12]When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that remain, that nothing may be lost.
\[13]Therefore they gathered [them], and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.
\[14]Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed, said, This is truly that prophet that should come into the world.
\[15]When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again to a mountain himself alone.
\[16]And when evening had [now] come, his disciples went down to the sea,
\[17]And entered into a boat, and went over the sea towards Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
\[18]And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
\[19]So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh to the boat: and they were afraid.
\[20]But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid.
\[21]Then they willingly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going.
\[22]The day following, when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples had gone away alone;
\[23](Yet there came other boats from Tiberias nigh to the place where they ate bread, after the Lord had given thanks:)
\[24]When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
\[25]And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
\[26]Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.
\[27]Labor not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
\[28]Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
\[29]Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
\[30]They said therefore to him, What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
\[31]Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
\[32]Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
\[33]For the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world.
\[34]Then said they to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
\[35]And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst.
\[36]But I said to you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
\[37]All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise reject.
\[38]For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\[39]And this is the Father's will who hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
\[40]And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\[41]The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
\[42]And they said, Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?
\[43]Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.
\[44]No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\[45]It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught from God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned from the Father, cometh to me.
\[46]Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is from God, he hath seen the Father.
\[47]Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.
\[48]I am that bread of life.
\[49]Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
\[50]This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die.
\[51]I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man shall eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
\[52]The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?
\[53]Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
\[54]Whoever eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
\[55]For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
\[56]He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
\[57]As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
\[58]This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
\[59]These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\[60]Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard [this], said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
\[61]When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Doth this offend you?
\[62][What] if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
\[63]It is the spirit that reviveth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak to you, [they] are spirit, and [they] are life.
\[64]But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him.
\[65]And he said, Therefore I said to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him by my Father.
\[66]From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
\[67]Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will ye also go away?
\[68]Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
\[69]And we believe, and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.
\[70]Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
\[71]He spoke of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon: for it was he that was to betray him, being one of the twelve.

fter these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
\[2]Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
\[3]His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
\[4]For [there is] no man [that] doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.
\[5](For neither did his brethren believe in him.)
\[6]Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.
\[7]The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.
\[8]Go ye up to this feast: I go not yet to this feast, for my time is not yet full come.
\[9]When he had said these words to them, he abode [still] in Galilee.
\[10]But when his brethren had gone up, then he went also to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
\[11]Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
\[12]And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceiveth the people.
\[13]Yet, no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
\[14]Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
\[15]And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
\[16]Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
\[17]If any man will do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God, or [whether] I speak from myself.
\[18]He that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
\[19]Did not Moses give you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
\[20]The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who goeth about to kill thee?
\[21]Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
\[22]Moses therefore gave to you circumcision, (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man.
\[23]If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath?
\[24]Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
\[25]Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
\[26]But lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
\[27]But we know this man, whence he is: whereas when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
\[28]Then cried Jesus in the temple, as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
\[29]But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
\[30]Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
\[31]And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?
\[32]The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him: and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
\[33]Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go to him that sent me.
\[34]Ye will seek me, and will not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.
\[35]Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
\[36]What [manner of] saying is this that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find [me]: and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come?
\[37]In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink.
\[38]He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
\[39](But this he spoke of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet [given], because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
\[40]Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, In truth this is the Prophet.
\[41]Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Will Christ come out of Galilee?
\[42]Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh from the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
\[43]So there was a division among the people because of him.
\[44]And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
\[45]Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?
\[46]The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.
\[47]Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived?
\[48]Have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?
\[49]But this people who know not the law are cursed.
\[50]Nicodemus saith to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them)
\[51]Doth our law judge [any] man before it heareth him, and knoweth what he doeth?
\[52]They answered and said to him, Art thou also from Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
\[53]And every man went to his own house.

esus went to the mount of Olives:
\[2]And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.
\[3]And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery: and when they had set her in the midst,
\[4]They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
\[5]Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what sayest thou?
\[6]This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not].
\[7]So when they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
\[8]And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
\[9]And they who heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
\[10]When Jesus had raised himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those thy accusers? hath no man condemned thee?
\[11]She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
\[12]Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
\[13]The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest concerning thyself; thy testimony is not true.
\[14]Jesus answered and said to them, Though I testify concerning myself, [yet] my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
\[15]Ye judge after the flesh, I judge no man.
\[16]And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
\[17]It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
\[18]I am one that testifieth concerning myself; and the Father that sent me, testifieth concerning me.
\[19]Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.
\[20]These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.
\[21]Then said Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.
\[22]Then said the Jews, will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
\[23]And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
\[24]I said therefore to you, that ye will die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye will die in your sins.
\[25]Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even [the same] that I said to you from the beginning.
\[26]I have many things to say, and to judge of you: but he that sent me, is true: and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.
\[27]They understood not that he spoke to them concerning the Father.
\[28]Then said Jesus to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
\[29]And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
\[30]As he spoke these words, many believed on him.
\[31]Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed;
\[32]And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
\[33]They answered him, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
\[34]Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Whoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.
\[35]And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, [but] the Son abideth for ever.
\[36]If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
\[37]I know that ye are Abraham's offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
\[38]I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
\[39]They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
\[40]But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.
\[41]Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.
\[42]Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
\[43]Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.
\[44]Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
\[45]And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.
\[46]Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?
\[47]He that is of God, heareth God's words: ye therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.
\[48]Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
\[49]Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.
\[50]And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
\[51]Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never see death.
\[52]Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never taste death.
\[53]Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
\[54]Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me, of whom ye say, that he is your God:
\[55]Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
\[56]Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw [it], and was glad.
\[57]Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
\[58]Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.
\[59]Then they took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.

nd as [Jesus] passed by, he saw a man who was blind from [his] birth.
\[2]And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
\[3]Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
\[4]I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work.
\[5]As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
\[6]When he had thus spoken, he spit on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
\[7]And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
\[8]The neighbors therefore, and they who before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
\[9]Some said, This is he: others [said], He is like him: [but] he said, I am [he].
\[10]Therefore they said to him, How were thy eyes opened?
\[11]He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus, made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
\[12]Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
\[13]They brought to the Pharisees him that before was blind.
\[14]And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
\[15]Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.
\[16]Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
\[17]They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thy eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
\[18]But the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
\[19]And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
\[20]His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
\[21]But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he will speak for himself.
\[22]These [words] his parents spoke, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man confessed that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\[23]Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
\[24]Then again they called the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
\[25]He answered and said, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.
\[26]Then they said to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thy eyes?
\[27]He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: Why would ye hear [it] again? will ye also be his disciples?
\[28]Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.
\[29]We know that God spoke to Moses: [as for] this [man], we know not whence he is.
\[30]The man answered and said to them, Why, herein is a marvelous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and [yet] he hath opened my eyes.
\[31]Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man is a worshiper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
\[32]Since the world began hath it not been heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
\[33]If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
\[34]They answered and said to him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? and they cast him out.
\[35]Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
\[36]He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?
\[37]And Jesus said to him, thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
\[38]And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.
\[39]And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they who see not, may see; and that they who see, may be made blind.
\[40]And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?
\[41]Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

erily, verily, I say to you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
\[2]But he that entereth by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.
\[3]To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
\[4]And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
\[5]And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
\[6]This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.
\[7]Then said Jesus to them again, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
\[8]All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
\[9]I am the door: by me if any man shall enter he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
\[10]The thief cometh not, but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and that they may have [it] more abundantly.
\[11]I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
\[12]But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
\[13]The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
\[14]I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep], and am known by mine.
\[15]As the Father knoweth me, even so I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\[16]And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, [and] one shepherd.
\[17]Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
\[18]No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from my Father.
\[19]There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
\[20]And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is insane; why hear ye him?
\[21]Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
\[22]And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
\[23]And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
\[24]Then came the Jews around him, and said to him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
\[25]Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I did in my Father's name, they testify concerning me.
\[26]But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.
\[27]My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
\[28]And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.
\[29]My Father, who gave [them to] me, is greater than all; and none is able to pluck [them] out of my Father's hand.
\[30]I and [my] Father are one.
\[31]Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
\[32]Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
\[33]The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
\[34]Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
\[35]If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
\[36]Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
\[37]If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
\[38]But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father [is] in me, and I in him.
\[39]Therefore they sought again to take him; but he escaped from their hand,
\[40]And went again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
\[41]And many resorted to him, and said, John performed no miracle; but all things that John spoke of this man were true.
\[42]And many believed on him there.

ow a certain [man] was sick, [named] Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
\[2](It was [that] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
\[3]Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
\[4]When Jesus heard [that], he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.
\[5]Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
\[6]When therefore he had heard that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
\[7]Then after that he saith to [his] disciples, Let us ho into Judea again.
\[8][His] disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
\[9]Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walketh in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
\[10]But if a man walketh in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
\[11]These things he said: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
\[12]Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepeth he will do well.
\[13]Now Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep.
\[14]Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
\[15]And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless, let us go to him.
\[16]Then said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
\[17]Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
\[18](Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs distant.)
\[19]And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\[20]Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat in the house.
\[21]Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
\[22]But I know that even now, whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it] thee.
\[23]Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again.
\[24]Martha saith to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
\[25]Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
\[26]And whoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die. Believest thou this?
\[27]She saith to him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.
\[28]And when she had so said, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
\[29]As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly, and came to him.
\[30]Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
\[31]The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth to the grave to weep there.
\[32]Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
\[33]When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled;
\[34]And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.
\[35]Jesus wept.
\[36]Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
\[37]And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
\[38]Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
\[39]Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by this time his body is offensive: for he hath been [dead] four days.
\[40]Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
\[41]Then they took away the stone [from the place] where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up [his] eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me:
\[42]And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people who stand by, I said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
\[43]And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
\[44]And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go.
\[45]Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
\[46]But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
\[47]Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and said, What do we? for this man performeth many miracles.
\[48]If we let him thus alone, all [men] will believe on him: and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.
\[49]And one of them, [named] Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, Ye know nothing at all,
\[50]Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
\[51]And this he spoke not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
\[52]And not for that nation only, but that also he should assemble in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
\[53]Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death.
\[54]Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
\[55]And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
\[56]Then they sought for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
\[57]Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show [it], that they might take him.

hen Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
\[2]There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
\[3]Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
\[4]Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], who was to betray him,
\[5]Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
\[6]This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put in it.
\[7]Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burial hath she kept this.
\[8]For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
\[9]Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
\[10]But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
\[11]Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
\[12]On the next day, many people that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\[13]Took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna; Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\[14]And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
\[15]Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
\[16]These things his disciples understood not at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written concerning him, and [that] they had done these things to him.
\[17]The people therefore that were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore testimony.
\[18]For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
\[19]The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
\[20]And there were certain Greeks among them, that came to worship at the feast.
\[21]The same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
\[22]Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again, Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
\[23]And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
\[24]Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
\[25]He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it to life eternal.
\[26]If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honor.
\[27]Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause I came to this hour.
\[28]Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again.
\[29]The people therefore that stood by, and heard [it], said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to him.
\[30]Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
\[31]Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
\[32]And I, if I shall be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] to me.
\[33](This he said, signifying what death he should die.)
\[34]The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
\[35]Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
\[36]While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and concealed himself from them.
\[37]But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
\[38]That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
\[39]Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,
\[40]He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
\[41]These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
\[42]Nevertheless, among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
\[43]For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
\[44]Jesus cried, and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me:
\[45]And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me:
\[46]I am come a light into the world, that whoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
\[47]And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
\[48]He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
\[49]For I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
\[50]And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak.

ow before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
\[2]And supper being ended (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], to betray him;)
\[3]Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was going to God;
\[4]He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
\[5]After that, he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel with which he was girded.
\[6]Then he cometh to Simon Peter: and Peter saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
\[7]Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
\[8]Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
\[9]Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and [my] head.
\[10]Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash [his] feet, but is wholly clean: and ye are clean, but not all.
\[11]For he knew who would betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
\[12]So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know ye what I have done to you?
\[13]Ye call me Master, and Lord: and ye say well; for [so] I am.
\[14]If I then, [your] Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.
\[15]For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
\[16]Verily, verily, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
\[17]If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
\[18]I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel against me.
\[19]Now I tell you before it cometh, that when it hath come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he].
\[20]Verily, verily, I say to you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
\[21]When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you will betray me.
\[22]Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.
\[23]Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom, one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
\[24]Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, to ask who it should be of whom he spoke.
\[25]He then lying on Jesus' breast, saith to him, Lord, who is it?
\[26]Jesus answered, He it is to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped [it]. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon.
\[27]And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly.
\[28]Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.
\[29]For some [of them] thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy [those things] that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
\[30]He then having received the sop, went immediately out: and it was night.
\[31]Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\[32]If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will immediately glorify him.
\[33]Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye will seek me: and, as I said to the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.
\[34]A new commandment I give to you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
\[35]By this shall all [men] know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
\[36]Simon Peter said to him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterward.
\[37]Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.
\[38]Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say to thee, The cock will not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.

\[4]And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
\[5]Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?

\[7]If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
\[8]Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

\[10]Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you, I speak not from myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

\[16]And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
\[17][Even] the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and will be in you.
\[18]I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.

\[21]He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
\[22]Judas, not Iscariot, saith to him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?
\[23]Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loveth me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.
\[24]He that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me.
\[25]These things have I spoken to you, being [yet] present with you.
\[26]But the Comforter, [who is] the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.
\[27]Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
\[28]Ye have heard that I said to you, I go away, and come [again] to you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
\[29]And now I have told you before it cometh to pass, that when it hath come to pass, ye may believe.
\[30]Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.

\[19]If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
\[20]Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
\[21]But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.
\[22]If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.
\[23]He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.
\[24]If I had not done among them the works which no other man hath done, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen, and hated both me and my Father.
\[25]But [this cometh to pass], that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
\[26]But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he will testify concerning me.
\[27]And ye also shall bear testimony, because ye have been with me from the beginning.

hese things have I spoken to you, that ye should not be offended.
\[2]They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time cometh, that whoever killeth you, will think that he doeth God service.
\[3]And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
\[4]But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you.
\[5]But now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
\[6]But because I have said these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
\[7]Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I depart; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.
\[8]And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
\[9]Of sin, because they believe not on me;
\[10]Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
\[11]Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
\[12]I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.
\[13]But, when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth: for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he shall hear, [that] will he speak: and he will show you things to come.
\[14]He will glorify me: for he will receive of mine, and will show [it] to you.
\[15]All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore I said, that he will take of mine, and show [it] to you.
\[16]A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
\[17]Then said [some] of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
\[18]They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.
\[19]Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that which I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
\[20]Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice: and ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
\[21]A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
\[22]And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.
\[23]And in that day ye will ask me nothing: Verily, verily, I say to you, Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give [it] you.
\[24]Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
\[25]These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time cometh when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly concerning the Father.
\[26]At that day ye will ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:
\[27]For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.
\[28]I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
\[29]His disciples said to him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
\[30]Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest from God.
\[31]Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
\[32]Behold, the hour cometh, and is even now come, that ye shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
\[33]These things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye will have tribulation, but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.

hese words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:
\[2]As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
\[3]And this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
\[4]I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
\[5]And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thy ownself, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
\[6]I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest to me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.
\[7]Now they have known that all things whatever thou hast given me are from thee.
\[8]For I have given to them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received [them], and have known surely that I came from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
\[9]I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given to me; for they are thine.
\[10]And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
\[11]And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thy own name those whom thou hast given to me, that they may be one, as we [are].
\[12]While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest to me I have kept, and none of them is lost but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
\[13]And now I come to thee, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
\[14]I have given to them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\[15]I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil.
\[16]They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\[17]Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
\[18]As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
\[19]And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.
\[20]Neither pray I for these alone; but for them also who shall believe on me through their word.
\[21]That they all may be one; as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
\[22]And the glory which thou gavest to me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one.
\[23]I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.
\[24]Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given to me be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory which thou hast given to me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
\[25]O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
\[26]And I have declared to them thy name, and will declare [it]: that the love with which thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them.

hen Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.
\[2]And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.
\[3]Judas then, having received a band [of men] and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
\[4]Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom seek ye?
\[5]They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them, I am [he]. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.
\[6]As soon then as he had said to them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.
\[7]Then he asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
\[8]Jesus answered, I have told you that I am [he]: If therefore ye seek me, let these go away:
\[9]That the saying might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of them whom thou gavest to me, I have lost none.
\[10]Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
\[11]Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
\[12]Then the band, and the captain, and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
\[13]And led him away to Annas first, (for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that same year.)
\[14]Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
\[15]And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple. That disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
\[16]But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple who was known to the high priest, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
\[17]Then saith the damsel that kept the door to Peter, Art not thou also [one] of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.
\[18]And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; (for it was cold) and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
\[19]The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his doctrine.
\[20]Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
\[21]Why dost thou ask me? ask them who heard me, what I have said to them: behold, they know what I have said.
\[22]And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers who stood by, struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
\[23]Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear testimony of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
\[24](Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.)
\[25]And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore to him, Art not thou also [one] of his disciples? He denied [it], and said, I am not.
\[26]One of the servants of the high priest (being the kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off) saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
\[27]Peter then denied again, and immediately the cock crowed.
\[28]Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
\[29]Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
\[30]They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.
\[31]Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
\[32]That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.
\[33]Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
\[34]Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing from thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?
\[35]Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee to me: What hast thou done?
\[36]Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
\[37]Pilate therefore said to him, Art thou a King then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
\[38]Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find in him no fault.
\[39]But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?
\[40]Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

hen Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged [him].
\[2]And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put [it] on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
\[3]And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
\[4]Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
\[5]Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And [Pilate] saith to them, Behold the man!
\[6]When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]. Pilate saith to them, Take ye him, and crucify [him]: for I find no fault in him.
\[7]The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
\[8]When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
\[9]And went again into the judgment-hall, and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
\[10]Then saith Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?
\[11]Jesus answered, Thou couldst have no power against me; except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee hath the greater sin.
\[12]And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar's friend. Whoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cesar.
\[13]When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\[14]And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King!
\[15]But they cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.
\[16]Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led [him] away.
\[17]And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha:
\[18]Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on each side one, and Jesus in the midst.
\[19]And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[20]Many of the Jews then read this title: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, [and] Latin.
\[21]Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
\[22]Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
\[23]Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\[24]They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
\[25]Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
\[26]When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
\[27]Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own [home].
\[28]After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
\[29]Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth.
\[30]When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and expired.
\[31]The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.
\[32]Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.
\[33]But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:
\[34]But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came out blood and water.
\[35]And he that saw [it], testified, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he speaketh truth, that ye may believe.
\[36]For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
\[37]And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
\[38]And after this, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.
\[39]And there came also Nicodemus (who at the first came to Jesus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound [weight].
\[40]Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
\[41]Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which was never man yet laid.
\[42]There they laid Jesus therefore, because of the Jews' preparation-[day], for the sepulcher was nigh at hand.

he first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, to the sepulcher, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.
\[2]Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.
\[3]Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.
\[4]So they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.
\[5]And he stooping down, saw the linen cloths lying; yet he went not in.
\[6]Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and seeth the linen cloths lying;
\[7]And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
\[8]Then went in also that other disciple who came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.
\[9]For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
\[10]Then the disciples went away again to their own home.
\[11]But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept she stooped down [to look] into the sepulcher,
\[12]And seeth two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\[13]And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? she saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
\[14]And when she had thus said, she turned herself about, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
\[15]Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
\[16]Jesus saith to her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith to him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.
\[17]Jesus saith to her, Touch me not: for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God.
\[18]Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had spoken these things to her.
\[19]Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith to them, Peace [be] to you.
\[20]And when he had so said, he showed to them [his] hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.
\[21]Then said Jesus to them again, Peace [be] to you: as [my] Father hath sent me, even so I send you.
\[22]And when he had said this, he breathed on [them], and saith to them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit.
\[23]Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; [and] whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.
\[24]But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
\[25]The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
\[26]And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: [then] came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] to you.
\[27]Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust [it] into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
\[28]And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.
\[29]Jesus saith to him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.
\[30]And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book.
\[31]But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life through his name.

fter these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias: and in this manner did he show [himself].
\[2]There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
\[3]Simon Peter saith to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a boat immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
\[4]But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
\[5]Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any victuals? They answered him, No.
\[6]And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
\[7]Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt [on] his fisher's coat, (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.
\[8]And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fishes.
\[9]As soon then as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid upon them, and bread.
\[10]Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
\[11]Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and notwithstanding there were so many, yet the net was not broken.
\[12]Jesus saith to them, Come [and] dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
\[13]Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.
\[14]This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
\[15]So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my lambs.
\[16]He saith to him again the second time, Simon [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yes, Lord: thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep.
\[17]He saith to him the third time, Simon [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith to him, Feed my sheep.
\[18]Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself and walk whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry [thee] whither thou wouldst not.
\[19]This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith to him, Follow me.
\[20]Then Peter turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following; (who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?)
\[21]Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, and what [shall] this man [do]?
\[22]Jesus saith to him, If I will that he shall tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.
\[23]Then this saying went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, if I will that he shall tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?
\[24]This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
\[25]And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.

he former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
\[2]Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen:
\[3]To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen by them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
\[4]And being assembled with [them], commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, [saith he], ye have heard from me.
\[5]For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence.
\[6]When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
\[7]And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.
\[8]But ye shall receive power after the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.
\[9]And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
\[10]And while they looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
\[11]Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up to heaven? this same Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
\[12]Then they returned to Jerusalem, from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.
\[13]And when they had come in, they went into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James [the son] of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James.
\[14]These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
\[15]And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said (the number of the names together were about a hundred and twenty,)
\[16]Men, brethren, This scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.
\[17]For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
\[18]Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
\[19]And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; so that that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
\[20]For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell in it: and, His bishopric let another take.
\[21]Wherefore, of these men who accompanied us, all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
\[22]Beginning from the baptism of John, to that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.
\[23]And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
\[24]And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all [men], show which of these two thou hast chosen,
\[25]That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
\[26]And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

nd when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
\[2]And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
\[3]And there appeared to them, cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
\[4]And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
\[5]And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
\[6]Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language.
\[7]And they were all amazed, and marveled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans?
\[8]And how do we hear every man in our own language, wherein we were born?
\[9]Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
\[10]Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and Proselytes,
\[11]Cretes and Arabians we hear them speak in our languages the wonderful works of God.
\[12]And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
\[13]Others mocking, said, These men are full of new wine.
\[14]But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Ye men of Judea, and all [ye] that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words:
\[15]For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is [but] the third hour of the day.
\[16]But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel,
\[17]And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
\[18]And on my servants, and on my hand-maidens I will, in those days, pour out of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
\[19]And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.
\[20]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.
\[21]And it shall come to pass, [that] whoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
\[22]Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
\[23]Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
\[24]Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
\[25]For David speaketh concerning him, I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
\[26]Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also, my flesh shall rest in hope:
\[27]Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption:
\[28]Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
\[29]Men, brethren, let me freely speak to you concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.
\[30]Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that from the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
\[31]He seeing this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.
\[32]This Jesus hath God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
\[33]Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
\[34]For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he saith himself, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
\[35]Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
\[36]Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
\[37]Now when they heard [this], they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men, brethren, what shall we do?
\[38]Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\[39]For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, [even] as many as the Lord our God shall call.
\[40]And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.
\[41]Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized: and the same day there were added [to them] about three thousand souls.
\[42]And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
\[43]And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
\[44]And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
\[45]And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all [men], as every man had need.
\[46]And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
\[47]Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

ow Peter and John went up together into the temple, at the hour of prayer, [being] the ninth [hour].
\[2]And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple.
\[3]Who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an alms.
\[4]And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
\[5]And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.
\[6]Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have I give thee: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.
\[7]And he took him by the right hand, and lifted [him] up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
\[8]And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
\[9]And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
\[10]And they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.
\[11]And as the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
\[12]And when Peter saw [it], he answered to the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
\[13]The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let [him] go.
\[14]But ye denied the Holy One, and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you,
\[15]And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; of which we are witnesses.
\[16]And his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yes, the faith which is by him, hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
\[17]And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did [it], as [did] also your rulers.
\[18]But those things which God before had shown by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
\[19]Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord,
\[20]And he will send Jesus Christ, who before was preached to you:
\[21]Whom the heaven must receive, until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, since the world began.
\[22]For Moses truly said to the fathers, A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up to you, of your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatever he shall say to you.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, [that] every soul who will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
\[24]And all the prophets also from Samuel, and those that follow, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold these days.
\[25]Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
\[26]To you first, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

nd as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them,
\[2]Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
\[3]And they laid hands on them, and put [them] in custody to the next day: for it was now evening.
\[4]But many of them who heard the word, believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
\[5]And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
\[6]And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were assembled at Jerusalem.
\[7]And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name have ye done this?
\[8]Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
\[9]If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made sound.
\[10]Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] by him doth this man stand here before you sound.
\[11]This is the stone which was set at naught by you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
\[12]Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we must be saved.
\[13]Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
\[14]And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
\[15]But when they had commanded them to withdraw from the council, they conferred among themselves,
\[16]Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them [is] manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny [it].
\[17]But that it may spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
\[18]And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.
\[19]But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than to God, judge ye.
\[20]For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
\[21]So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all [men] glorified God for that which was done.
\[22]For the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was performed.
\[23]And being dismissed, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
\[24]And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou [art] God, who hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that is in them;
\[25]Who, by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
\[26]The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were assembled against the Lord, and against his Christ.
\[27]For in truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were assembled,
\[28]To do whatever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
\[29]And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant to thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
\[30]By stretching forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
\[31]And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
\[32]And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one soul: neither said any [of them] that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
\[33]And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
\[34]Neither was there any among them that was in want: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
\[35]And laid [them] down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made to every man according as he had need.
\[36]And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, [and] of the country of Cyprus,
\[37]Having land, sold [it], and brought the money, and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.

ut a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
\[2]And kept back [part] of the price, (his wife also being privy [to it]) and brought a certain part, and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.
\[3]But Peter said, Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back [part] of the price of the land?
\[4]While it remained, was it not thy own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God.
\[5]And Ananias hearing these words, fell down, and expired. And great fear came on all them that heard these things.
\[6]And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried [him] out, and buried [him].
\[7]And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
\[8]And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.
\[9]Then Peter said to her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband [are] at the door, and shall carry thee out.
\[10]Then she fell down immediately at his feet, and expired. And the young men came in, and found her dead, and carrying [her] forth, buried [her] by her husband.
\[11]And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
\[12]And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
\[13]And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.
\[14]And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)
\[15]So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid [them] on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
\[16]There came also a multitude [out] of the cities around to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons, and them who were afflicted with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
\[17]Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him; (which is the sect of the Sadducees) and were filled with indignation,
\[18]And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
\[19]But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison-doors, and brought them forth, and said,
\[20]Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
\[21]And when they heard [that], they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\[22]But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
\[23]Saying, The prison truly we found shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
\[24]Now when the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them to what this would grow.
\[25]Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
\[26]Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
\[27]And when they had brought them, they set [them] before the council: and the high priest asked them,
\[28]Saying, Did we not strictly command you, that ye should not teach in this name? and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.
\[29]Then Peter and the [other] apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
\[30]The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree:
\[31]Him hath God exalted with his right hand [to be] a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
\[32]And we are his witnesses of these things; and [so is] also the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
\[33]When they heard [that], they were cut [to the heart], and took counsel to slay them.
\[34]Then stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little time.
\[35]And said to them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do concerning these men:
\[36]For before these days rose Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to naught.
\[37]After this man rose Judas of Galilee, in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, [even] as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
\[38]And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work is from men, it will come to naught:
\[39]But if it is from God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.
\[40]And to him they assented: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten [them], they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\[41]And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
\[42]And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

\[2]Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
\[3]Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\[4]But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
\[5]And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
\[6]Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid [their] hands on them.
\[7]And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

\[9]Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called [the synagogue] of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia, and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

\[13]And set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
\[14]For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.

hen said the high priest, Are these things so?
\[2]And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
\[3]And said to him, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
\[4]Then he came from the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran. And from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land in which ye now dwell.
\[5]And he gave him no inheritance in it, no not [so much as] to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his offspring after him, when [as yet] he had no child.
\[6]And God spoke on this wise, That his offspring should sojourn in a foreign land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat [them] ill four hundred years.
\[7]And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that they shall come forth, and serve me in this place.
\[8]And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so [Abraham] begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac [begat] Jacob, and Jacob [begat] the twelve patriarchs.
\[9]And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
\[10]And delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt, and all his house.
\[11]Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction; and our fathers found no sustenance.
\[12]But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
\[13]And at the second [time] Joseph was made known to his brethren: and Joseph's kindred was made known to Pharaoh.
\[14]Then Joseph sent, and called his father Jacob to [him], and all his kindred, seventy five souls.
\[15]So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
\[16]And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor [the father] of Sychem.
\[17]But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\[18]Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph.
\[19]The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and ill-treated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
\[20]In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished in his father's house three months:
\[21]And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
\[22]And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
\[23]And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
\[24]And seeing one [of them] suffer wrong, he defended [him], and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
\[25]For he supposed his brethren to understand that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
\[26]And the next day he showed himself to them as they were contending, and would have constrained them to be at peace again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren: why do ye wrong one to another?
\[27]But he that did his neighbor wrong, thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
\[28]Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?
\[29]Then Moses fled at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
\[30]And when forty years had expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
\[31]When Moses saw [it], he wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to behold [it], the voice of the Lord came to him,
\[32][Saying], I [am] the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
\[33]Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
\[34]I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
\[35]This Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send [to be] a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
\[36]He brought them out, after he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
\[37]This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, A prophet will the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like me; him will ye hear.
\[38]This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on the mount Sina, and [with] our fathers: who received the living oracles to give to us:
\[39]Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust [him] from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
\[40]Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for [as for] this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\[41]And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
\[42]Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices [during] forty years in the wilderness?
\[43]Yes, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
\[44]Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
\[45]Which also our fathers, that came after, brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;
\[46]Who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
\[47]But Solomon built him a house.
\[48]Yet, the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet,
\[49]Heaven [is] my throne, and earth [is] my footstool: What house will ye build for me? saith the Lord: or what [is] the place of my rest?
\[50]Hath not my hand made all these things?
\[51]Ye stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers [did], so [do] ye.
\[52]Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them who showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers;
\[53]Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept [it].
\[54]When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with [their] teeth.
\[55]But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
\[56]And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
\[57]Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
\[58]And cast [him] out of the city, and stoned [him]: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.
\[59]And they stoned Stephen, calling upon [God], and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
\[60]And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

nd Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\[2]And devout men carried Stephen [to his burial], and made great lamentation over him.
\[3]As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and hauling men and women committed [them] to prison.
\[4]Therefore they that were dispersed went every where preaching the word.
\[5]Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.
\[6]And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he performed.
\[7]For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
\[8]And there was great joy in that city.
\[9]But there was a certain man called Simon, who before in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
\[10]To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
\[11]And to him they had regard, because that for a long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
\[12]But when they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women.
\[13]Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
\[14]Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:
\[15]Who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit:
\[16](For as yet he had fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
\[17]Then they laid [their] hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
\[18]And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
\[19]Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
\[20]But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
\[21]Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
\[22]Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
\[23]For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and [in] the bond of iniquity.
\[24]Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
\[25]And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
\[26]And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.
\[27]And he arose, and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
\[28]Was returning; and sitting in his chariot, read Isaiah the prophet.
\[29]Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot.
\[30]And Philip ran thither to [him], and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
\[31]And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up, and sit with him.
\[32]The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so he opened not his mouth:
\[33]In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
\[34]And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
\[35]Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.
\[36]And as they went on [their] way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, [here is] water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
\[37]And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
\[38]And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
\[39]And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
\[40]But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through, he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cesarea.

nd Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
\[2]And desired from him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he should find any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
\[3]And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined around him a light from heaven:
\[4]And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
\[5]And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. [It is] hard for thee to kick against the goads.
\[6]And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord [said] to him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
\[7]And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
\[8]And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought [him] into Damascus.
\[9]And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
\[10]And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I [am here], Lord.
\[11]And the Lord [said] to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for [one] called Saul of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth,
\[12]And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in, and putting [his] hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
\[13]Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
\[14]And here he hath authority from the chief priests, to bind all that call on thy name.
\[15]But the Lord said to him, Go, for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.
\[16]For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
\[17]And Ananias went, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord ([even] Jesus that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest) hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
\[18]And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
\[19]And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples who were at Damascus.
\[20]And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
\[21]But all that heard [him] were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed them who called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?
\[22]But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
\[23]And after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him.
\[24]But their laying in wait, was known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
\[25]Then the disciples took him by night, and let [him] down by the wall in a basket.
\[26]And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
\[27]But Barnabas took him, and brought [him] to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
\[28]And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
\[29]And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
\[30][Which] when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
\[31]Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified: and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.
\[32]And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all [quarters], he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.
\[33]And there he found a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years, and was sick with the palsy.
\[34]And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
\[35]And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
\[36]Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, who by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did.
\[37]And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom, when they had washed, they laid in an upper chamber.
\[38]And as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent to him two men, desiring [him] that he would not delay to come to them.
\[39]Then Peter arose, and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
\[40]But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
\[41]And he gave her [his] hand, and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
\[42]And it was known throughout all Joppa: and many believed in the Lord.

here was a certain man in Cesarea, called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian [band],
\[2][A] devout [man], and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.
\[3]He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
\[4]And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms are come up for a memorial before God.
\[5]And now send men to Joppa, and call for [one] Simon, whose surname is Peter:
\[6]He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side: he will tell thee what thou oughtest to do.
\[7]And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
\[8]And when he had declared all [these] things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
\[9]On the morrow, as they were going on their journey, and drew nigh to the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour:
\[10]And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
\[11]And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending to him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
\[12]In which were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping animals, and fowls of the air.
\[13]And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
\[14]But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
\[15]And the voice [spoke] to him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, [that] call not thou common.
\[16]This was done thrice: and the vessel was received again into heaven.
\[17]Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and were standing before the gate,
\[18]And called, and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there.
\[19]While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee.
\[20]Arise therefore, and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
\[21]Then Peter went down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what [is] the cause for which ye have come?
\[22]And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee.
\[23]Then he called them in, and lodged [them]. And on the morrow Peter went with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
\[24]And on the morrow they entered into Cesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
\[25]And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshiped [him].
\[26]But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up: I myself also am a man.
\[27]And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that had come together.
\[28]And he said to them, Ye know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God hath shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
\[29]Therefore I came [to you] without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
\[30]And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
\[31]And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
\[32]Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he lodgeth in the house of [one] Simon a tanner, by the sea-side: who, when he cometh, will speak to thee.
\[33]Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou hast come. Now therefore we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee from God.
\[34]Then Peter opened [his] mouth, and said, In truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
\[35]But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
\[36]The word which [God] sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
\[37]That word, [I say], ye know, which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
\[38]That God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.
\[39]And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree.
\[40]Him God raised the third day, and showed him openly;
\[41]Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, [even] to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
\[42]And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who was ordained by God [to be] the Judge of the living and the dead.
\[43]To him give all the prophets testimony, that through his name whoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.
\[44]While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them who heard the word.
\[45]And they of the circumcision who believed, were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\[46]For they heard them speak in languages and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
\[47]Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
\[48]And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they requested him to tarry certain days.

nd the apostles and brethren that were in Judea, heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
\[2]And when Peter had come to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
\[3]Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
\[4]But Peter rehearsed [the matter] from the beginning, and expounded [it] by order to them, saying,
\[5]I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
\[6]Upon which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping animals, and fowls of the air.
\[7]And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
\[8]But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.
\[9]But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, [that] call not thou common.
\[10]And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
\[11]And behold, immediately there were three men already come to the house where I was, sent from Cesarea to me.
\[12]And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover, these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:
\[13]And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
\[14]Who shall tell thee words, by which thou and all thy house shall be saved.
\[15]And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
\[16]Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
\[17]Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as [he did] to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I that I could withstand God?
\[18]When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life.
\[19]Now they who were dispersed upon the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.
\[20]And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
\[21]And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.
\[22]Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
\[23]Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave to the Lord.
\[24]For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith: and many people were added to the Lord.
\[25]Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to seek Saul:
\[26]And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
\[27]And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.
\[28]And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Cesar.
\[29]Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea.
\[30]Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

ow about that time, Herod the king stretched forth [his] hands to afflict certain of the church.
\[2]And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
\[3]And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. Then were the days of unleavened bread.
\[4]And when he had apprehended him, he put [him] in prison, and delivered [him] to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people.
\[5]Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing by the church to God for him.
\[6]And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
\[7]And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon [him], and a light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise quickly. And his chains fell off from [his] hands.
\[8]And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals; and so he did. And he saith to him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
\[9]And he went out, and followed him, and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
\[10]When they were past the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
\[11]And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know with certainty, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and [from] all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
\[12]And when he had considered [the thing], he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were assembled, praying.
\[13]And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.
\[14]And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate
\[15]And they said to her, Thou art insane. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then they said, It is his angel.
\[16]But Peter continued knocking. And when they had opened [the door], and saw him, they were astonished.
\[17]But he beckoning to them with the hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go, show these things to James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
\[18]Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
\[19]And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that [they] should be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Cesarea, and [there] abode.
\[20]And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon. But they came with one accord to him, and having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace, because their country was nourished by the king's [country].
\[21]And upon a set day, Herod arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration to them.
\[22]And the people gave a shout, [saying], [It is] the voice of a god, and not of a man.
\[23]And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten by worms, and died.
\[24]But the word of God grew and multiplied.

ow there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
\[2]As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.
\[3]And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid [their] hands on them, they sent [them] away.
\[4]So they being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, departed to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
\[5]And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had also John for [their] minister.
\[6]And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name [was] Barjesus:
\[7]Who was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
\[8]But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
\[9]Then Saul (who also [is called] Paul) filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him,
\[10]And said, O full of all subtilty, and all mischief, [thou] child of the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
\[11]And now behold, the hand of the Lord [is] upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
\[12]Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
\[13]Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.
\[14]But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath, and sat down.
\[15]And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.
\[16]Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with [his] hand, said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
\[17]The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he brought them out of it.
\[18]And about the time of forty years he suffered their manners in the wilderness.
\[19]And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
\[20]And after that he gave [to them] judges, about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
\[21]And afterward they desired a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
\[22]And when he had removed him, he raised up to them David to be their king: to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the [son] of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who shall fulfill all my will.
\[23]Of this man's offspring hath God, according to [his] promise, raised up to Israel a Savior, Jesus:
\[24]John having first preached, before his coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\[25]And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not [he]. But behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of [his] feet I am not worthy to loose.
\[26]Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
\[27]For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the words of the prophets which are read every sabbath, they have fulfilled [them] in condemning [him].
\[28]And though they found no cause of death [in him], yet they desired Pilate that he should be put to death.
\[29]And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning him, they took [him] down from the tree, and laid [him] in a sepulcher.
\[30]But God raised him from the dead:
\[31]And he was seen many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
\[32]And we declare to you the glad tidings, that the promise which was made to the fathers,
\[33]God hath fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
\[34]And as concerning that he raised him from the dead, [now] no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
\[35]Wherefore he saith also in another [psalm], Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
\[36]For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:
\[37]But he whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
\[38]Be it known to you therefore, men, brethren, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins;
\[39]And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
\[40]Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets;
\[41]Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe, though a man declare it to you.
\[42]And when the Jews had gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
\[43]Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
\[44]And the next sabbath came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
\[45]But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were uttered by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
\[46]Then Paul and Barnabas became bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you: but seeing ye reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
\[47]For so hath the Lord commanded us, [saying], I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldst be for salvation to the ends of the earth.
\[48]And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.
\[49]And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
\[50]But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.
\[51]But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
\[52]And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

nd it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews, and also of the Greeks, believed.
\[2]But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil-affected against the brethren.
\[3]A long time therefore they abode speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
\[4]But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
\[5]And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews, with their rulers, to use [them] despitefully, and to stone them,
\[6]Being apprised of [it], they fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the region in that vicinity.
\[7]And there they preached the gospel.
\[8]And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who had never walked.
\[9]The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
\[10]Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
\[11]And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.
\[12]And they called Barnabas, Jupiter, and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
\[13]Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
\[14][Which], when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard [of], they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
\[15]And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you, that ye should turn from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them.
\[16]Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
\[17]Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
\[18]And with these sayings they scarce restrained the people from doing sacrifice to them.
\[19]And there came thither [certain] Jews from Antioch, and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew [him] out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
\[20]But as the disciples stood around him, he rose, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
\[21]And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and [to] Iconium, and to Antioch,
\[22]Confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
\[23]And when they had ordained for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
\[24]And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
\[25]And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
\[26]And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they fulfilled.
\[27]And when they had come, and had assembled the church, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and that he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
\[28]And there they abode a long time with the disciples.

nd certain men who came down from Judea, taught the brethren, [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
\[2]When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.
\[3]And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice, and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brethren.
\[4]And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
\[5]But there rose certain of the sect of the Pharisees, who believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses.
\[6]And the apostles and elders came together to consider of this matter.
\[7]And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose and said to them, Men, brethren, ye know that a good while ago, God made choice among us, that the Gentiles, by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
\[8]And God, who knoweth the hearts, bore them witness, giving to them the Holy Spirit, even as [he did] to us:
\[9]And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
\[10]Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\[11]But we believe, that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even as they.
\[12]Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought by them among the Gentiles.
\[13]And after they held their peace, James answered, saying, Men, brethren, hearken to me.
\[14]Simeon hath declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take from among them a people for his name.
\[15]And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
\[16]After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins of it; and I will set it up:
\[17]That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
\[18]Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
\[19]Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, who from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
\[20]But that we write to them that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] lewdness, and [from] things strangled, and [from] blood.
\[21]For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.
\[22]Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
\[23]And they wrote [letters] by them after this manner; The apostles, and elders, and brethren, [send] greeting to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia.
\[24]Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain who went out from us, have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, [Ye must] be circumcised, and keep the law; to whom we gave no [such] commandment:
\[25]It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul:
\[26]Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[27]We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will also tell [you] the same things by mouth.
\[28]For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
\[29]That ye abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from lewdness: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye will do well. Fare ye well.
\[30]So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had convened the multitude, they delivered the epistle.
\[31][Which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
\[32]And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed [them].
\[33]And after they had tarried [there] a time, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren to the apostles.
\[34]Notwithstanding, it pleased Silas to abide there still.
\[35]Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
\[36]And some days after, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren, in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, [and see] how they do.
\[37]And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
\[38]But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
\[39]And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed, separating one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus.
\[40]And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.
\[41]And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

hen he came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman who was a Jewess, and believed, but his father [was] a Greek.
\[2]Who was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
\[3]Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those quarters: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
\[4]And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep that were ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.
\[5]And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
\[6]Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia;
\[7]After they had come to Mysia, they essayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.
\[8]And they, passing by Mysia, came down to Troas.
\[9]And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
\[10]And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering, that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.
\[11]Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next [day] to Neapolis;
\[12]And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, [and] a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
\[13]And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women who resorted [thither].
\[14]And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, heard [us]: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken by Paul.
\[15]And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought [us], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there]: And she constrained us.
\[16]And it came to pass as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination, met us, who brought her masters much gain by sooth-saying:
\[17]The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who show to us the way of salvation.
\[18]And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
\[19]And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew [them] into the market-place to the rulers,
\[20]And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
\[21]And teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
\[22]And the multitude rose together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat [them].
\[23]And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely.
\[24]Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
\[25]And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.
\[26]And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
\[27]And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
\[28]But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
\[29]Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas;
\[30]And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
\[31]And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
\[32]And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
\[33]And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed [their] stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, without delay.
\[34]And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
\[35]And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
\[36]And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.
\[37]But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast [us] into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.
\[38]And the sergeants told these words to the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans.
\[39]And they came and besought them, and brought [them] out, and desired [them] to depart out of the city.
\[40]And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house of] Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.

ow when they had passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews.
\[2]And Paul, as his manner was, went in to them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
\[3]Opening and alledging, that it was needful that Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ.
\[4]And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas: and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
\[5]But the Jews who believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain vile fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city in an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
\[6]And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down, have come hither also;
\[7]Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, That there is another king, [one] Jesus.
\[8]And they troubled the people, and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
\[9]And when they had taken security of Jason and of the other, they let them go.
\[10]And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming [thither], went into the synagogue of the Jews.
\[11]These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
\[12]Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women who were Greeks, and of men not a few.
\[13]But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
\[14]And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still.
\[15]And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.
\[16]Now, while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
\[17]Therefore he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
\[18]Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? some others, He seemeth to be a setter-forth of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.
\[19]And they took him, and brought him to Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine [is], of which thou speakest?
\[20]For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears; we would know therefore what these things mean.
\[21](For all the Athenians and strangers who were there, spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
\[22]Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars-hill, and said, [Ye] men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
\[23]For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.
\[24]God that made the world, and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
\[25]Neither is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
\[26]And hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
\[27]That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he is not far from every one of us:
\[28]For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, for we are also his offspring.
\[29]Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold, or silver, or stone graven by art and man's device.
\[30]And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
\[31]Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness, by [that] man whom he hath ordained: [of which] he hath given assurance to all [men], in that he hath raised him from the dead.
\[32]And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again concerning this [matter].
\[33]So Paul departed from among them.
\[34]But certain men adhered to him, and believed: among whom [was] Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

fter these things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
\[2]And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and [he] came to them.
\[3]And because he was of the same occupation, he abode with them, and wrought (for by their occupation they were tent-makers)
\[4]And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
\[5]And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews, [that] Jesus [was] Christ.
\[6]And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment, and said to them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads: I [am] clean: from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.
\[7]And he departed thence, and entered into the house of a certain man named Justus, [one] that worshiped God, whose house joined close to the synagogue.
\[8]And Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house: and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized.
\[9]Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:
\[10]For I am with thee, and no man shall lay hands on thee, to hurt thee: for I have many people in this city.
\[11]And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\[12]And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat,
\[13]Saying, This [man] persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
\[14]And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong, or hainous crime, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
\[15]But if it is a question of words and names, and [of] your law, look ye [to it]: for I will be no judge of such [matters].
\[16]And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
\[17]Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
\[18]And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while, and took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
\[19]And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
\[20]When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not:
\[21]But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
\[22]And when he had landed at Cesarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
\[23]And after he had spent some time [there], he departed and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
\[24]And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
\[25]This man was instructed in the way of the Lord: and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
\[26]And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: Whom, when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to [them], and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.
\[27]And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he had come, helped them much who had believed through grace.
\[28]For he mightily convinced the Jews, [and that] publicly, showing by the scriptures, that Jesus was Christ.

nd it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper region, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples,
\[2]He said to them, Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed? And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there is any Holy Spirit.
\[3]And he said to them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.
\[4]Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, That they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
\[5]When they heard [this], they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
\[6]And when Paul had laid [his] hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke in languages, and prophesied.
\[7]And all the men were about twelve.
\[8]And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
\[9]But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
\[10]And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
\[11]And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
\[12]So that from his body were brought to the sick, handkerchiefs, or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
\[13]Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them who had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
\[14]And there were seven sons of [one] Sceva a Jew, [and] chief of the priests, who did so.
\[15]And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
\[16]And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\[17]And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus: and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
\[18]And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.
\[19]Many also of them who used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all [men]; and they counted the price of them, and found [it] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.
\[20]So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed.
\[21]After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia, and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
\[22]So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
\[23]And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
\[24]For a certain [man] named Demetrius, a silver-smith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the artificers;
\[25]Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth:
\[26]Moreover, ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away many people, saying, that they are no gods which are made with hands.
\[27]So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at naught; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia, and the world worshipeth.
\[28]And when they heard [these sayings], they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.
\[29]And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater.
\[30]And when Paul would have entered in to the people, the disciples suffered him not.
\[31]And certain of the chief of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him, desiring [him] that he would not adventure himself into the theater.
\[32]Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not why they had come together.
\[33]And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.
\[34]But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great [is] Diana of the Ephesians.
\[35]And when the town-clerk had appeased the people, he said, [Ye] men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?
\[36]Seeing then that these things cannot be contradicted, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
\[37]For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
\[38]Wherefore, if Demetrius and the artificers who are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.
\[39]But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
\[40]For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause by which we may give an account of this concourse.

nd after the uproar had ceased, Paul called to [him] the disciples, and embraced [them], and departed to go into Macedonia.
\[2]And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,
\[3]And [there] abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.
\[4]And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus.
\[5]These going before, tarried for us at Troas.
\[6]And we sailed away from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
\[7]And upon the first [day] of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them (ready to depart on the morrow) and continued his speech until midnight.
\[8]And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were assembled.
\[9]And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, having fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell from the third loft, and was taken up dead.
\[10]And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing [him], said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.
\[11]When he had come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and discoursed a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
\[12]And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
\[13]And we went before to a ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot.
\[14]And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
\[15]And we sailed thence, and came the next [day] over against Chios; and the next [day] we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next [day] we came to Miletus.
\[16]For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
\[17]And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
\[18]And when they had come to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
\[19]Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:
\[20][And] how I kept back nothing that was profitable [to you], but have shown you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,
\[21]Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[22]And now behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
\[23]Save that the Holy Spirit testifieth in every city, saying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.
\[24]But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
\[25]And now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
\[26]Wherefore I call you to witness this day, that I [am] pure from the blood of all [men].
\[27]For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.
\[28]Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
\[29]For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
\[30]Also from your own selves will men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
\[31]Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
\[32]And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them who are sanctified.
\[33]I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.
\[34]And ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.
\[35]I have shown you all things, that so laboring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
\[36]And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
\[37]And they all wept bitterly, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,
\[38]Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.

nd it came to pass, that after we were separated from them, and had lanched, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the [day] following to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara:
\[2]And finding a ship sailing over to Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
\[3]Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
\[4]And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
\[5]And when we had accomplished those days, we departed, and proceeded on our way; and they all conducted us with wives and children, till [we were] out of the city; and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
\[6]And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
\[7]And when we had finished [our] course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
\[8]And the next [day] we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Cesarea; and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was [one] of the seven; and abode with him.
\[9]And the same man had four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.
\[10]And as we tarried [there] many days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
\[11]And when he had come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and will deliver [him] into the hands of the Gentiles.
\[12]And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\[13]Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep, and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
\[14]And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
\[15]And after those days we took up our furniture, and went up to Jerusalem.
\[16]There went with us also [certain] of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
\[17]And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
\[18]And the [day] following Paul went in with us to James: and all the elders were present.
\[19]And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
\[20]And when they heard [it], they glorified the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
\[21]And they are informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying, That they ought not to circumcise [their] children, neither to walk after the customs.
\[22]What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
\[23]Do therefore this that we say to thee: we have four men who have a vow on them;
\[24]Take them, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave [their] heads: and all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but [that] thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
\[25]As concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written [and] concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from [things] offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from lewdness.
\[26]Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them, entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an offering should be offered for every one of them.
\[27]And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews who were from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
\[28]Crying out, Men of Israel, help. This is the man that teacheth all [men] every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further, hath brought Greeks also into the temple; and hath polluted this holy place.
\[29](For they had seen before with him in the city, Trophimus, an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
\[30]And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul and drew him out of the temple. And forthwith the doors were shut.
\[31]And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
\[32]Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating Paul.
\[33]Then the chief captain came near and took him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains: and inquired who he was, and what he had done.
\[34]And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
\[35]And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne by the soldiers, for the violence of the people.
\[36]For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him.
\[37]And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
\[38]Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
\[39]But Paul said, I am a man [who am] a Jew of Tarsus, [a city] of Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee suffer me to speak to the people.
\[40]And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made entire silence, he spoke to [them] in the Hebrew language, saying,

en, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defense [which I make] now to you.
\[2](And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
\[3]I am verily a man [who am] a Jew, born in Tarsus, [a city] in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, [and] taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, being zealous towards God, as ye all are this day.
\[4]And I persecuted this way even to death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
\[5]As also the high priest doth bear me testimony, and all the estate of the elders; from whom also I received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them who were there bound to Jerusalem, to be punished.
\[6]And it came to pass, that as I was passing on my journey, and had come nigh to Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light around me.
\[7]And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
\[8]And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
\[9]And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.
\[10]And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which are appointed for thee to do.
\[11]And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
\[12]And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews who dwelt [there],
\[13]Came to me, and stood, and said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
\[14]And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth.
\[15]For thou shalt be his witness to all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
\[16]And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
\[17]And it came to pass, that when I had come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
\[18]And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem; for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
\[19]And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned, and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
\[20]And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
\[21]And he said to me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence to the Gentiles.
\[22]And they gave him audience to this word, and [then] lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a [man] from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
\[23]And as they cried out, and cast off [their] clothes, and threw dust into the air,
\[24]The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know for what cause they cried so against him.
\[25]And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
\[26]When the centurion heard [that], he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest; for this man is a Roman.
\[27]Then the chief captain came, and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yes.
\[28]And the chief captain answered, With a great sum I obtained this freedom. And Paul said, But I was [free] born.
\[29]Then forthwith they departed from him who were about to examine him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
\[30]On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from [his] bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

nd Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men, brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
\[2]And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him, to strike him on the mouth.
\[3]Then said Paul to him, God shall smite thee, [thou] whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
\[4]And they that stood by, said, Revilest thou God's high priest?
\[5]Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he is the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
\[6]But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
\[7]And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
\[8]For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
\[9]And there arose a great cry: and the scribes [that were] of the Pharisees' part arose, and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
\[10]And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul would have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring [him] into the castle.
\[11]And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified concerning me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear testimony also at Rome.
\[12]And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
\[13]And they were more than forty who had made this conspiracy.
\[14]And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
\[15]Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, before he shall come near, are ready to kill him.
\[16]And when the son of Paul's sister heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
\[17]Then Paul called one of the centurions to [him], and said, Bring this young man to the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
\[18]So he took him, and brought [him] to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me to [him], and prayed me to bring this young man to thee, who hath something to say to thee.
\[19]Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went [with him] aside privately, and asked [him], What is that thou hast to tell me?
\[20]And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldst bring down Paul to-morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat concerning him more perfectly.
\[21]But do not thou yield to them: for there are of them who lie in wait for him more than forty men, who have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now they are ready, looking for a promise from thee.
\[22]So the chief captain [then] let the young man depart, and charged [him], [See thou] tell no man that thou hast shown these things to me.
\[23]And he called to [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
\[24]And provide [for them] beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring [him] safe to Felix the governor.
\[25]And he wrote a letter after this manner:
\[26]Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix, [sendeth] greeting.
\[27]This man was taken by the Jews, and would have been killed by them: then I came with a body of soldiers, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
\[28]And when I would have known the cause for which they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
\[29]Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death, or of bonds.
\[30]And when it was told to me that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent forthwith to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also, to say before thee what [they had] against him. Farewell.
\[31]Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought [him] by night to Antipatris.
\[32]On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
\[33]Who, when they came to Cesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
\[34]And when the governor had read [the letter], he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia,
\[35]I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers also have come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment-hall.

nd after five days, Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
\[2]And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by thy providence,
\[3]We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
\[4]Notwithstanding, that I may not be further tedious to thee, I pray thee, that thou wouldst of thy clemency hear us a few words.
\[5]For we have found this a pestilent man, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
\[6]Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
\[7]But the chief captain Lysias came and with great violence took [him] out of our hands,
\[8]Commanding his accusers to come to thee: by examining whom, thou thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him.
\[9]And the Jews also assented, saying, that these things were so.
\[10]Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been for many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
\[11]That thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
\[12]And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither exciting the people to sedition, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
\[13]Neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
\[14]But this I confess to thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
\[15]And have hope towards God, which they themselves also allow, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
\[16]And in this I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offense towards God, and [towards] men.
\[17]Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
\[18]Upon which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
\[19]Who ought to have been here before thee, and object if they had aught against me.
\[20]Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil-doing in me, while I stood before the council,
\[21]Except it is for this one voice, that I cried, standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
\[22]And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
\[23]And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister, or come to him.
\[24]And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
\[25]And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, depart for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
\[26]He hoped also that money would have been given him by Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
\[27]But after two years Porcius Festus came as successor to Felix: and Felix willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

ow when Festus had come into the province, after three days he ascended from Cesarea to Jerusalem.
\[2]Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
\[3]And desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
\[4]But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Cesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly [thither].
\[5]Let them therefore, said he, who among you are able, go down with [me], and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him.
\[6]And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down to Cesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment-seat, commanded Paul to be brought.
\[7]And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove;
\[8]While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Cesar have I committed any offense.
\[9]But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these things before me?
\[10]Then said Paul, I stand at Cesar's tribunal, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
\[11]For if I am an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there is none of these things of which these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Cesar.
\[12]Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed to Cesar? to Cesar thou shalt go.
\[13]And after certain days, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea, to salute Festus.
\[14]And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause to the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
\[15]About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], desiring [to have] judgment against him.
\[16]To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before he who is accused hath the accusers face to face, and hath license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
\[17]Therefore, when they had come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth;
\[18]Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed:
\[19]But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
\[20]And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked [him] whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these matters.
\[21]But when Paul had appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Cesar.
\[22]Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
\[23]And on the morrow, when Agrippa had come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and had entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought forth.
\[24]And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and [also] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
\[25]But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
\[26]Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.
\[27]For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not also to signify the crimes [laid] against him.

hen Agrippa said to Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
\[2]I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee, concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews:
\[3]Especially, [because I know] thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
\[4]My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews,
\[5]Who knew me from the beginning, (if they would testify) that after the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
\[6]And now I stand, and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers:
\[7]To which [promise] our twelve tribes, assiduously serving [God] day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
\[8]Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
\[9]I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
\[10]Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them].
\[11]And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted [them] even to foreign cities.
\[12]Upon which as I went to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief priests,
\[13]At mid-day, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, surpassing the brightness of the sun, shining around me, and them who journeyed with me.
\[14]And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? [It is] hard for thee to kick against the goads.
\[15]And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
\[16]But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou hast seen, and of the things in which I will appear to thee;
\[17]Delivering thee from the people, and [from] the Gentiles, to whom now I send thee,
\[18]To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them who are sanctified by faith that is in me.
\[19]Upon which O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
\[20]But showed first to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and [then] to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
\[21]For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill [me].
\[22]Having therefore obtained help from God, I continue to this day, testifying both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
\[23]That Christ should suffer, [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.
\[24]And as he was thus speaking for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee insane.
\[25]But he said, I am not insane, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
\[26]For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
\[27]King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
\[28]Then Agrippa said to Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
\[29]And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
\[30]And when he had thus spoken, the king rose, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
\[31]And when they had gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.
\[32]Then said Agrippa to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cesar.

nd when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to [one] named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.
\[2]And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we lanched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, [one] Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
\[3]And the next [day] we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave [him] liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself.
\[4]And when we had lanched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
\[5]And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Mira, [a city] of Lycia.
\[6]And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
\[7]And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce had come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone:
\[8]And hardly passing it, came to a place which is called, The fair havens; nigh to which was the city [of] Lasea.
\[9]Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished [them].
\[10]And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
\[11]Nevertheless, the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than the things which were spoken by Paul.
\[12]And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, [and there] to winter; [which is] a haven of Crete, and lieth towards the south-west and north-west.
\[13]And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, loosing [thence], they sailed close by Crete.
\[14]But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
\[15]And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let [her] drive.
\[16]And running under a certain isle which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
\[17]Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.
\[18]And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;
\[19]And the third [day] we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
\[20]And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on [us], all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
\[21]But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
\[22]And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of life among you, but of the ship.
\[23]For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
\[24]Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Cesar: and lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
\[25]Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it will be even as it was told to me.
\[26]But we must be cast upon a certain isle.
\[27]When the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen suspected that they drew near to some country:
\[28]And sounded, and found [it] twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found [it] fifteen fathoms.
\[29]Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
\[30]And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would cast anchors out of the foreship,
\[31]Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
\[32]Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
\[33]And while the day was coming on, Paul besought [them] all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
\[34]Wherefore I pray you to take [some] food; for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you.
\[35]And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken [it], he began to eat.
\[36]Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took food.
\[37]And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy six souls.
\[38]And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast the wheat into the sea.
\[39]And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into which they purposed, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
\[40]And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] to the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted the mainsail to the wind, and made towards the shore.
\[41]And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained immovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
\[42]And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
\[43]But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from [their] purpose, and commanded that they who could swim, should cast [themselves] first [into the sea], and get to land:
\[44]And the rest, some on boards, and some on [broken pieces] of the ship: And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.

nd when they had escaped, then they knew that the isle was called Melita.
\[2]And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
\[3]And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
\[4]And when the barbarians saw the animal hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
\[5]And he shook off the animal into the fire, and felt no harm.
\[6]Yet they looked when he would have swelled, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
\[7]In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the isle, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
\[8]And it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick with a fever, and a bloody-flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
\[9]So when this was done, others also who had diseases in the isle, came, and were healed:
\[10]Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.
\[11]And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
\[12]And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.
\[13]And from thence we made a circuit, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
\[14]Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went towards Rome.
\[15]And from thence when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii-forum, and the Three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
\[16]And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him.
\[17]And it came to pass, that after three days, Paul called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were assembled, he said to them, Men, brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
\[18]Who when they had examined me, would have let [me] go, because there was no cause of death in me.
\[19]But when the Jews spoke against [it], I was constrained to appeal to Cesar; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of.
\[20]For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see [you], and to speak with [you]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
\[21]And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning thee, neither have any of the brethren that came shown or spoken any harm of thee.
\[22]But we desire to hear from thee, what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
\[23]And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.
\[24]And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
\[25]And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit by Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,
\[26]Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.
\[27]For the heart of this people is become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
\[28]Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.
\[29]And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
\[30]And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in to him,
\[31]Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.

aul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,
\[2](Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures)
\[3]Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh.
\[4]And declared [to be] the Son of God, with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
\[5]By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name:
\[6]Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
\[7]To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[8]First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
\[9]For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,
\[10]Making request (if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God) to come to you.
\[11]For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
\[12]That is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me.
\[13]Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come to you (but have been hitherto hindered) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
\[14]I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the barbarians, both to the wise, and to the unwise.
\[15]So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
\[16]For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
\[17]For in this is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
\[18]For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
\[19]Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them; for God hath shown [it] to them.
\[20]For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
\[21]Because that when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
\[22]Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools:
\[23]And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping animals.
\[24]Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:
\[25]Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
\[26]For this cause God gave them up to vile affections. For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
\[27]And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.
\[28]And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
\[29]Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
\[30]Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventers of evil things, disobedient to parents,
\[31]Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
\[32]Who, knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death; not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

herefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art, that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest, doest the same things.
\[2]But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them who commit such things.
\[3]And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
\[4]Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
\[5]But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
\[6]Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
\[7]To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality; eternal life:
\[8]But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness; indignation and wrath:
\[9]Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
\[10]But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile;
\[11]For there is no respect of persons with God.
\[12]For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law,
\[13](For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
\[14]For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law to themselves.
\[15]Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing testimony, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one another)
\[16]In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
\[17]Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
\[18]And knowest [his] will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,
\[19]And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,
\[20]An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law:
\[21]Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
\[22]Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
\[23]Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God?
\[24]For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written.
\[25]For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keepest the law; but if thou art a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
\[26]Therefore, if the uncircumcision keepeth the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
\[27]And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfilleth the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
\[28]For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
\[29]But he [is] a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the spirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not from men, but from God.

hat advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit [is there] of circumcision?
\[2]Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.
\[3]For what if some did not believe? will their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
\[4]By no means: verily let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.
\[5]But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man.)
\[6]By no means: for then how shall God judge the world?
\[7]For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
\[8]And not [rather] (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
\[9]What then? are we better [than they]? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
\[10]As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
\[11]There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh God.
\[12]They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
\[13]Their throat [is] an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:
\[14]Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness.
\[15]Their feet [are] swift to shed blood.
\[16]Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:
\[17]And the way of peace have they not known.
\[18]There is no fear of God before their eyes.
\[19]Now we know that whatever things the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
\[20]Therefore by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.
\[21]But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being testified by the law and the prophets;
\[22]Even the righteousness of God, [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ to all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference:
\[23]For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
\[24]Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:
\[25]Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
\[26]To declare, [I say], at this time his righteousness: that he may be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.
\[27]Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No; but by the law of faith.
\[28]Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
\[29][Is he] the God of the Jews only? [is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
\[30]Seeing [it is] one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

\[2]For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath [whereof] to glory, but not before God.
\[3]For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
\[4]Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
\[5]But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
\[6]Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
\[7][Saying], Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
\[8]Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
\[9][Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only], or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
\[10]How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
\[11]And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they are not circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also;
\[12]And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.
\[13]For the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
\[14]For if they who are of the law [are] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of no effect.
\[15]Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.
\[16]Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all;
\[17](As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) before him whom he believed, [even] God, who reviveth the dead, and calleth those things which are not, as though they were.
\[18]Who against hope believed with hope, that he should become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
\[19]And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb.
\[20]He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
\[21]And being fully persuaded, that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
\[22]And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
\[23]Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
\[24]But for us also, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,

herefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:
\[2]By whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
\[3]And not only [so], but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
\[4]And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
\[5]And hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.
\[6]For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
\[7]For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.
\[8]But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
\[9]Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
\[10]For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
\[11]And not only [so], but we also joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
\[12]Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.
\[13]For until the law, sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
\[14]Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
\[15]But not as the offense, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded to many.
\[16]And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift. For the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offenses to justification.
\[17]For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.
\[18]Therefore, as by the offense of one, [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men to justification of life.
\[19]For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
\[20]Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
\[21]That as sin hath reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.

hat shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
\[2]By no means: how shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
\[3]Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?
\[4]Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
\[5]For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:
\[6]Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin may be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
\[7]For he that is dead is freed from sin.
\[8]Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
\[9]Knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
\[10]For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth to God.
\[11]Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
\[12]Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts of it.
\[13]Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness to God:
\[14]For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
\[15]What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? By no means.
\[16]Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants in obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
\[17]But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
\[18]Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
\[19]I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity, to ([work]) iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness, to ([work]) holiness.
\[20]For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
\[21]What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.
\[22]But now being made free from sin, and having become servants to God, ye have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.
\[23]For the wages of sin [is] death: but the gift of God [is] eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

now ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
\[2]For the woman who hath a husband, is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband is dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband.
\[3]So then, if while [her] husband liveth, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband is dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
\[4]Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.
\[5]For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death:
\[6]But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead by which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] the oldness of the letter.
\[7]What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? By no means. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
\[8]But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin [was] dead.
\[9]For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
\[10]And the commandment which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] to death.
\[11]For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].
\[12]Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
\[13]Was then that which is good made death to me? By no means. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
\[14]For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
\[15]For that which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do.
\[16]If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that [it is] good.
\[17]Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
\[18]For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform that which is good, I find not.
\[19]For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.
\[20]Now if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
\[21]I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.
\[22]For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man:
\[23]But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
\[24]O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
\[25]I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

There is] therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
\[2]For the law of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
\[3]For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
\[4]That the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
\[5]For they that are according to the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh: but they that are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
\[6]For to be carnally minded [is] death; but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace:
\[7]Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
\[8]So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
\[9]But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. Now if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
\[10]And if Christ [is] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness.
\[11]But if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised Christ from the dead will also revive your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
\[12]Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
\[13]For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
\[14]For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
\[15]For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.
\[16]The Spirit itself testifieth with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
\[17]And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if we suffer with [him], that we may be glorified together.
\[18]For I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
\[19]For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
\[20]For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected [the same] in hope:
\[21]Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
\[22]For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now:
\[23]And not only [they], but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.
\[24]For we are saved by hope: But hope that is seen, is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
\[25]But if we hope for what we see not, [then] with patience we wait for [it].
\[26]Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
\[27]And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints, according to [the will of] God.
\[28]And we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose.
\[29]For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.
\[30]Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
\[31]What shall we then say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [can be] against us?
\[32]He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
\[33]Who will lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? [It is] God that justifieth:
\[34]Who [is] he that condemneth? [It is] Christ that died, or rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
\[35]Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
\[36]As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
\[37]But in all these things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.
\[38]For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
\[39]Nor hight, nor depth, nor any other creature, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

\[6]Not as though the word of God hath taken no effect. For they [are] not all Israel, who are [descendants] from Israel?
\[7]Neither because they are the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
\[8]That is, They who are the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
\[9]For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
\[10]And not only [this]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac,
\[11](For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth)
\[12]It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.
\[13]As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
\[14]What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? By no means.
\[15]For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
\[16]So then, [it is] not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.
\[17]For the scripture saith to Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
\[18]Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will [have mercy], and whom he will he hardeneth.
\[19]Thou wilt say then to me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted his will?
\[20]No, but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?
\[21]Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?
\[22][What] if God, willing to show [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
\[23]And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory,
\[24]Even us whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.
\[25]As he saith also in Hosea, I will call them My people, who were not my people; and her Beloved, who was not beloved.
\[26]And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not my people; there shall they be called, The children of the living God.
\[27]Isaiah also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
\[28]For he will finish the work, and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
\[29]And as Isaiah said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and been made like Gomorrah.
\[30]What shall we say then? That the Gentiles who followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith:
\[31]But Israel, who followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
\[32]Why? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone;

rethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved.
\[2]For I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
\[3]For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.
\[4]For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
\[5]For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, That the man who doeth these things shall live by them.
\[6]But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down.)
\[7]Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring Christ again from the dead.)
\[8]But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
\[9]That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
\[10]For with the heart man believeth to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.
\[11]For the scripture saith, whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
\[12]For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all, is rich to all that call upon him,
\[13]For whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\[14]How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
\[15]And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?
\[16]But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
\[17]So then, faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
\[18]But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
\[19]But I say, Did not Israel know? First, Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by [them that are] no people, [and] by a foolish nation I will anger you.
\[20]But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found by them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not for me.

\[2]God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
\[3]Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thy altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
\[4]But what saith the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
\[5]Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
\[6]And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
\[7]What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.
\[8](According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.
\[9]And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompense to them:
\[10]Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.
\[11]I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? By no means: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
\[12]Now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?
\[13]For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:
\[14]If by any means I may incite to emulation [them who are] my flesh, and may save some of them.
\[15]For if the rejection of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be], but life from the dead?
\[16]For if the first fruit [is] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]: and if the root [is] holy, so [are] the branches.
\[17]And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive-tree, art ingrafted among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive-tree;
\[18]Boast not against the branches. But if thou boastest, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
\[19]Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be ingrafted.
\[20]Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear:
\[21]For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not thee.
\[22]Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them who fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou shalt continue in [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
\[23]And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be ingrafted: for God is able to ingraft them again.
\[24]For if thou wast cut out of the olive-tree which is wild by nature, and wast ingrafted contrary to nature into a good olive-tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural [branches], be grafted into their own olive-tree?
\[25]For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits) that blindness in part hath happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles shall be come in.
\[26]And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
\[27]For this [is] my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.
\[28]As concerning the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as concerning the election, [they are] beloved for the father's sakes.
\[29]For the gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.
\[30]For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief;
\[31]Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
\[32]For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
\[33]O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
\[34]For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counselor?
\[35]Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?

\[16]Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
\[17]For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
\[18]For he that in these things serveth Christ, [is] acceptable to God, and approved by men.
\[19]Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.
\[20]For the sake of food, destroy not the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offense.
\[21][It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] by which thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
\[22]Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
\[23]And he that doubteth is damned if he eateth, because [he eateth] not from faith: for whatever [is] not from faith is sin.

e then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
\[2]Let every one of us please [his] neighbor for [his] good to edification.
\[3]For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
\[4]For whatever things were written formerly, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
\[5]Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another according to Christ Jesus:
\[6]That ye may with one mind [and] one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[7]Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
\[8]Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] to the fathers:
\[9]And that the Gentiles might glorify God for [his] mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name.
\[10]And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
\[11]And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
\[12]And again Isaiah saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
\[13]Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.
\[14]And I myself also am persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
\[15]Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God.
\[16]That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
\[17]I have therefore cause for glorying through Jesus Christ, in those things which pertain to God.
\[18]For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
\[19]Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
\[20]And so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:
\[21]But as it is written, They shall see to whom he was not spoken of: and they that have not heard shall understand.
\[22]For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
\[23]But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;
\[24]Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I shall be somewhat filled with your [company].
\[25]But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.
\[26]For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who are at Jerusalem.
\[27]It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.
\[28]When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.
\[29]And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
\[30]Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me;
\[31]That I may be delivered from them in Judea who do not believe; and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints;
\[32]That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
\[33]Now the God of peace [be] with you all. Amen.

\[17]Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them who cause divisions and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
\[18]For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.
\[19]For your obedience is come abroad to all [men]. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise to that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

aul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes [our] brother,
\[2]To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.
\[3]Grace [be] to you, and peace from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[4]I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
\[5]That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and [in] all knowledge;
\[6]Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
\[7]So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
\[8]Who will also confirm you to the end, [that ye may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[9]God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
\[10]Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.
\[11]For it hath been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by them [who are of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
\[12]Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
\[13]Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
\[14]I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
\[15]Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.
\[16]And I baptized also the household of Stephanas; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
\[17]For Christ hath not sent me to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.
\[18]For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God.
\[19]For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
\[20]Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
\[21]For when in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
\[22]For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:
\[23]But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness;
\[24]But to them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
\[25]Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
\[26]For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble [are called]:
\[27]But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
\[28]And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are:
\[29]That no flesh should glory in his presence.
\[30]But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who from God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
\[31]That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

nd I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellence of speech, or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
\[2]For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
\[3]And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
\[4]And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power:
\[5]That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
\[6]However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to naught:
\[7]But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom] which God ordained before the world to our glory:
\[8]Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known [it], they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\[9]But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
\[10]But God hath revealed [them] to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God.
\[11]For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
\[12]Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God.
\[13]Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
\[14]But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.
\[15]But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged by no man.
\[16]For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

\[2]I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.
\[3]For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
\[4]For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
\[5]Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
\[6]I have planted, Apollos watered: but God hath given the increase.
\[7]So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.
\[8]Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labor.
\[9]For we are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, [ye are] God's building.
\[10]According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth upon it. But let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it.
\[11]For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
\[12]Now if any man buildeth upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
\[13]Every man's work will be made manifest: for the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will try every man's work, of what sort it is.
\[14]If any man's work abideth which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward.
\[15]If any man's work shall be burned, he will suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
\[16]Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
\[17]If any man defileth the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.
\[18]Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
\[19]For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
\[20]And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
\[21]Therefore let no man glory in men: for all things are yours:
\[22]Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;

\[2]Moreover, it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful.
\[3]But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.
\[4]For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
\[5]Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord shall come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise from God.
\[6]And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself, and [to] Apollos, for your sakes; that ye may learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you on account of one, may be puffed up against another.
\[7]For who maketh thee to differ [from another]? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received [it]?
\[8]Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
\[9]For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.
\[10]We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but ye [are] wise in Christ; we [are] weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honorable, but we [are] despised.
\[11]Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;
\[12]And labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
\[13]Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things to this day.
\[14]I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you].
\[15]For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
\[16]Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
\[17]For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who will bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
\[18]Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
\[19]But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power.
\[20]For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.

\[2]And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
\[3]For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already as though I were present, [concerning] him that hath so done this deed,

\[5]I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that will be able to judge between his brethren?
\[6]But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.

\[8]But ye do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.
\[9]Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
\[10]Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

ow concerning the things of which ye wrote to me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.
\[2]Nevertheless, [to avoid] lewdness, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
\[3]Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.
\[4]The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
\[5]Defraud ye not one the other, except with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan may not tempt you for your incontinence.
\[6]But I speak this by permission, [and] not as a commandment.
\[7]For I would that all men were as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.
\[8]I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.
\[9]But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
\[10]And to the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:
\[11]But if she shall depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husband put away [his] wife.
\[12]But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, if any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
\[13]And the woman who hath a husband that believeth not, and if he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
\[14]For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
\[15]But if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such [cases]; but God hath called us to peace.
\[16]For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife?
\[17]But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all churches.
\[18]Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not become circumcised.
\[19]Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
\[20]Let every man continue in the same calling in which he was called.
\[21]Art thou called [being] a servant? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather.
\[22]For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord's free-man: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ's servant.
\[23]Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
\[24]Brethren, let every man in the state in which he is called, continue in it with God.
\[25]Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful.
\[26]I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, [I say], that [it is] good for a man so to be.
\[27]Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
\[28]But if thou marry, thou hast not sinned: and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless, such will have trouble in the flesh; but I spare you.
\[29]But this I say, brethren, The time [is] short. It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none;
\[30]And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
\[31]And they that use this world, as not abusing [it]. For the fashion of this world passeth away.
\[32]But I would have you without anxious care. He that is unmarried, is anxious for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
\[33]But he that is married, is anxious for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife.
\[34]There is a difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy, both in body and in spirit: but she that is married, is anxious for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband.
\[35]And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
\[36]But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself uncomely towards his virgin, if she hath passed the flower of [her] age, and need so requireth, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
\[37]Nevertheless, he that standeth steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
\[38]So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth better.
\[39]The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband is dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
\[40]But she is happier if she so remain, after my judgment; and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

ow as concerning things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
\[2]And if any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
\[3]But if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.
\[4]Therefore as concerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that [there is] no other God but one.
\[5]For though there are that are called gods, whether in heaven or upon earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many)
\[6]Yet to us [there is but] one God, the Father, from whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him.
\[7]But [there is] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat [it] as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
\[8]But food commendeth us not to God: for neither if we eat, are we the better; neither if we eat not, are we the worse.
\[9]But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours should become a stumbling-block to them that are weak.
\[10]For if any man shall see thee, who hast knowledge, sit eating in the idol's temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
\[11]And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
\[12]But when ye thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
\[13]Wherefore, if food maketh my brother to fall into sin, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to fall into sin.

m I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord?
\[2]If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for ye are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
\[3]My answer to them that examine me is this,
\[4]Have we not power to eat and to drink?
\[5]Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
\[6]Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power to forbear working?
\[7]Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of its fruit? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
\[8]Do I say these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
\[9]For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
\[10]Or saith he [this] altogether for our sakes? for our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
\[11]If we have sown to you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
\[12]If others are partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
\[13]Do ye not know that they who minister about holy things live [from the things] of the temple, and they who wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
\[14]Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel.
\[15]But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
\[16]For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!
\[17]For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation [of the gospel] is committed to me.
\[18]What is my reward then? [Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my power in the gospel.
\[19]For though I am free from all [men], yet I have made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.
\[20]And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
\[21]To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
\[22]To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all things to all [men], that I might by all means save some.
\[23]And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I may be partaker of it with [you].
\[24]Know ye not, that they who run in a race, all run, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
\[25]And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
\[26]I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I fight, not as one that beateth the air:
\[27]But I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest by any means when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away.

oreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
\[2]And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
\[3]And all ate the same spiritual food;
\[4]And all drank the same spiritual drink: (for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.)
\[5]But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
\[6]Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
\[7]Neither be ye idolaters, as [were] some of them: as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
\[8]Neither let us commit lewdness, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
\[9]Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.
\[10]Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
\[11]Now all these things happened to them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
\[12]Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.
\[13]There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].
\[14]Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
\[15]I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
\[16]The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
\[17]For we [being] many are one bread, [and] one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
\[18]Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they who eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?
\[19]What then do I say? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
\[20]But [I say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons.
\[21]Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of demons.
\[22]Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
\[23]All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
\[24]Let no man seek his own, but every man another's [wealth].
\[25]Whatever is sold in the provision market, [that] eat, asking no question for conscience' sake:
\[26]For the earth [is] the Lord's, and its fullness.
\[27]If any of them that believe not invites you [to a feast], and ye are disposed to go; whatever is set before you, eat, asking no question on account of conscience.
\[28]But if any man shall say to you, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience' sake: for the earth [is] the Lord's, and its fullness:
\[29]Conscience, I say, not thy own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another [man's] conscience?
\[30]For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
\[31]Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
\[32]Give no offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
\[33]Even as I please all [men] in all [things], not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved.

e ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.
\[2]Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you.
\[3]But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.
\[4]Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonoreth his head.
\[5]But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with [her] head uncovered, dishonoreth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaved.
\[6]For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.
\[7]For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
\[8]For the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man.
\[9]Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
\[10]For this cause ought the woman to have power on [her] head, because of the angels.
\[11]Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord.
\[12]For as the woman [is] from the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things from God.
\[13]Judge in yourselves: Is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered?
\[14]Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man hath long hair, it is a shame to him?
\[15]But if a woman hath long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering.
\[16]But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
\[17]Now in this that I declare [to you], I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
\[18]For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
\[19]For there must be also heresies among you, that they who are approved may be made manifest among you.
\[20]When therefore ye come together in one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord's supper.
\[21]For in eating every one taketh before [another] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
\[22]What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.
\[23]For I have received from the Lord, that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, the [same] night in which he was betrayed, took bread:
\[24]And when he had given thanks, he broke [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
\[25]After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.
\[26]For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he shall come.
\[27]Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
\[28]But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.
\[29]For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
\[30]For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
\[31]For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
\[32]But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
\[33]Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
\[34]And if any man hungereth, let him eat at home; that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

ow concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
\[2]Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
\[3]Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.
\[4]Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
\[5]And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
\[6]And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all.
\[7]But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit.
\[8]For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
\[9]To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
\[10]To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, [divers] kinds of languages; to another, the interpretation of languages:
\[11]But all these worketh that one and the same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
\[12]For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ.
\[13]For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
\[14]For the body is not one member, but many.
\[15]If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
\[16]And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
\[17]If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?
\[18]But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
\[19]And if they were all one member, where [were] the body?
\[20]But now [are they] many members, yet but one body.
\[21]And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
\[22]Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
\[23]And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.
\[24]For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked:
\[25]That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.
\[26]And thus if one member suffers all the members suffer with it; or, if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
\[27]Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
\[28]And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, next miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of languages.
\[29][Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workers of miracles?
\[30]Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak in languages? do all interpret?
\[31]But covet earnestly the best gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.

hough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
\[2]And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
\[3]And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
\[4]Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
\[5]Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
\[6]Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
\[7]Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
\[8]Charity never faileth: but whether [there are] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there are] languages, they shall cease; whether [there is] knowledge, it shall vanish away.

\[10]But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
\[11]When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

ollow after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts], but rather that ye may prophesy.
\[2]For he that speaketh in an [unknown] language, speaketh not to men, but to God: for no man understandeth [him]; yet in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
\[3]But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men [to] edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
\[4]He that speaketh in an [unknown] language edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
\[5]I would that ye all spoke in languages, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater [is] he that prophesieth than he that speaketh in languages, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
\[6]Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in languages, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
\[7]And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
\[8]For if the trumpet shall give an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
\[9]So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will speak into the air.
\[10]There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification.
\[11]Therefore, if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh [will be] a barbarian to me.
\[12]Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
\[13]Wherefore, let him that speaketh in an [unknown] language, pray that he may interpret.
\[14]For if I pray in an [unknown] language, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
\[15]What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
\[16]Else, when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
\[17]For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
\[18]I thank my God, I speak in languages more than ye all:
\[19]Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] language.
\[20]Brethren, be not children in understanding: yet in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
\[21]In the law it is written, With [men of] other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
\[22]Wherefore languages are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that believe not, but for them who believe.
\[23]If therefore the whole church is assembled in one place, and all speak in languages, and there come in [those that are] unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are insane?
\[24]But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or [one] unlearned, he is convinced by all, he is judged by all:
\[25]And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on [his] face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you in truth.
\[26]How is it then, brethren? when ye are assembled, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a language, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification.
\[27]If any man speaketh in an [unknown] language, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret.
\[28]But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
\[29]Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge.
\[30]If [any thing] is revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
\[31]For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
\[32]And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
\[33]For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
\[34]Let your women keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted to them to speak: but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
\[35]And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home; for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
\[36]What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?
\[37]If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
\[38]But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
\[39]Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak in languages.

oreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also ye have received, and in which ye stand;
\[2]By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached to you, unless ye have believed in vain.
\[3]For I delivered to you first of all, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures;
\[4]And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
\[5]And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:
\[6]After that he was seen by above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some have fallen asleep.
\[7]After that he was seen by James; then by all the apostles.
\[8]And last of all he was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.
\[9]For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
\[10]But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which [was bestowed] upon me, was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
\[11]Therefore whether [it was] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
\[12]Now if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
\[13]But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not raised.
\[14]And if Christ is not raised, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain.
\[15]And indeed we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified concerning God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not, if in truth the dead rise not.
\[16]For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
\[17]And if Christ is not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins.
\[18]Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
\[19]If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
\[20]But now is Christ raised from the dead, [and] become the first-fruits of them that slept.
\[21]For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.
\[22]For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
\[23]But every man in his own order: Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
\[24]Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power.
\[25]For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
\[26]The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.
\[27]For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under [him], [it is] manifest that he is excepted who did put all things under him.
\[28]And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
\[29]Else what will they do, who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
\[30]And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
\[31]I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
\[32]If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die.
\[33]Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt good manners.
\[34]Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak [this] to your shame.
\[35]But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?
\[36][Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not vivified except it die:
\[37]And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain; it may be of wheat, or of some other [grain]:
\[38]But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed its own body.
\[39]All flesh [is] not the same flesh; but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of fowls.
\[40][There are] also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [is] one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial [is] another.
\[41][There is] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for [one] star differeth from [another] star in glory.
\[42]So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption:
\[43]It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power:
\[44]It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
\[45]And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam [was made] a vivifying spirit.
\[46]However, that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
\[47]The first man [is] from the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from heaven.
\[48]As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.
\[49]And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
\[50]Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
\[51]Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
\[52]In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
\[53]For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.
\[54]So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
\[55]O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?
\[56]The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
\[57]But thanks [be] to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[58]Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

ow concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
\[2]Upon the first [day] of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God] hath prospered him, that there be no collections when I come.
\[3]And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem.
\[4]And if it be proper that I should go also, they shall go with me.
\[5]Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I am to pass through Macedonia.
\[6]And it may be that I shall abide, and even winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
\[7]For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
\[8]But I shall tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
\[9]For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and [there are] many adversaries.
\[10]Now if Timothy come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do].
\[11]Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brethren.
\[12]As concerning [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
\[13]Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, acquit yourselves like men, be strong.
\[14]Let all your things be done with charity.
\[15]I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
\[16]That ye submit yourselves to such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboreth.
\[17]I am glad of the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part, they have supplied.
\[18]For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
\[19]The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
\[20]All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.
\[21]The salutation of [me] Paul with my own hand.
\[22]If any man loveth not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maran-atha.
\[23]The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.
\[24]My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

aul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:
\[2]Grace [be] to you and peace from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[3]Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation.
\[4]Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble by the consolation with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
\[5]For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
\[6]And whether we are afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we are comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation.
\[7]And our hope of you [is] steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so [shall ye be] also of the consolation.
\[8]For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:
\[9]But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:
\[10]Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us]:
\[11]Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift [bestowed] upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
\[12]For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our manner of life in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
\[13]For we write no other things to you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye will acknowledge even to the end;
\[14]As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
\[15]And in this confidence I purposed to come to you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
\[16]And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.
\[17]When I therefore was thus minded, did I use levity? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay?
\[18]But [as] God [is] true, our word towards you was not yea and nay.
\[19]For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.
\[20]For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.
\[21]Now he who establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, [is] God;
\[22]Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.
\[23]Moreover, I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I have not as yet come to Corinth.
\[24]Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.

ut I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
\[2]For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me?
\[3]And I wrote this same to you, lest, coming I should have sorrow from them by whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.
\[4]For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.
\[5]But if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
\[6]Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] by many.
\[7]So that on the other hand, ye [ought] rather to forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such one should be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.
\[8]Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] love towards him.
\[9]For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
\[10]To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [I forgave it], in the person of Christ;
\[11]Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
\[12]Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,
\[13]I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
\[14]Now thanks [be] to God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place.
\[15]For we are to God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
\[16]To the one [we are] the savor of death to death; and to the other the savor of life to life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?
\[17]For we are not as many, who corrupt the word of God: but as from sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.

o we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you.
\[2]Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men:
\[3][Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart.
\[4]And such trust we have through Christ toward God.
\[5]Not that we are sufficient by ourselves to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] from God;
\[6]Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
\[7]But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven on stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away;
\[8]How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?
\[9]For if the ministration of condemnation [was] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
\[10]For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
\[11]For if that which was done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
\[12]Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
\[13]And not as Moses, [who] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
\[14]But their minds were blinded: for until this day the same vail remaineth untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.
\[15]But even to this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
\[16]Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
\[17]Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
\[18]But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.

\[2]But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty; not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but, by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
\[3]But if our gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
\[4]In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.
\[5]For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
\[6]For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
\[7]But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God, and not from us.
\[8][We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;
\[9]Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
\[10]Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body.
\[11]For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
\[12]So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
\[13]We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
\[14]Knowing, that he who raised the Lord Jesus, will raise us also by Jesus, and will present [us] with you.
\[15]For all things [are] for your sakes, that the abundant grace may, through the thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of God.
\[16]For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is wasted, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by day.
\[17]For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;
\[18]While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.

or we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
\[2]For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our house which is from heaven:
\[3]If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
\[4]For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not because we would be unclothed, but clothed, that mortality might be swallowed up in life.
\[5]Now he that hath wrought us for this same thing [is] God, who also hath given to us the earnest of the Spirit.
\[6]Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
\[7](For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
\[8]We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
\[9]Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted by him.
\[10]For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to what he hath done, whether good or bad.
\[11]Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
\[12]For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
\[13]For whether we are beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we are sober, [it is] for your cause.
\[14]For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
\[15]And [that] he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again.
\[16]Wherefore henceforth we know no man according to the flesh: though indeed we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth we know [him] no more.
\[17]Therefore, if any man [is] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.
\[18]And all things [are] from God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
\[19]To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation.
\[20]Now then we are embassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

\[4]Great [is] my boldness of speech towards you, great [is] my glorying concerning you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
\[5]For, when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without [were] fightings, within [were] fears.
\[6]Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
\[7]And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind towards me; so that I rejoiced the more.
\[8]For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though [it was] but for a season.
\[9]Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
\[10]For godly sorrow worketh penitence to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
\[11]For behold this very thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, [what] clearing of yourselves, yea, [what] indignation, yea, [what] fear, yea, [what] vehement desire, yea, [what] zeal, yea, [what] avenging! In all [things] ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
\[12]Wherefore, though I wrote to you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.
\[13]Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: and exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
\[14]For if I have boasted any thing to him concerning you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which [I made] before Titus, is found a truth.
\[15]And his tender affection is more abundant towards you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.

oreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
\[2]That in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality.
\[3]For to [their] power, I bear testimony, and even beyond [their] power, [they were] willing of themselves;
\[4]Praying us with much entreaty, that we would receive the gift, and [take upon us] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
\[5]And [this they did], not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God:
\[6]So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
\[7]Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing], [in] faith and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.
\[8]I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
\[9]For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
\[10]And in this I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
\[11]Now therefore finish the doing [of it]; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which ye have.
\[12]For if there is first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to what a man hath, [and] not according to what he hath not.
\[13]For [I mean] not that other men should be eased, and you burdened:
\[14]But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:
\[15]As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no want.
\[16]But thanks [be] to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
\[17]For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went to you.
\[18]And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches;
\[19]And not [that] only, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and [declaration of] your ready mind:
\[20]Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
\[21]Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
\[22]And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved [to be] diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which [I have] in you.
\[23]If [any inquire] concerning Titus, [he is] my partner and fellow-helper concerning you: or our brethren [be inquired of], [they are] the messengers of the churches, [and] the glory of Christ.
\[24]Wherefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

\[3]Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
\[4]Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
\[5]Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before to you, and make up before hand your bounty, of which ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not [of] covetousness.

\[11]Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
\[12]For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;
\[13]While by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal distribution to them, and to all [men];

\[2]For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.
\[3]But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
\[4]For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or [if] ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with [him].
\[5]For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very greatest apostles.
\[6]But though [I am] rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.
\[7]Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God without reward?
\[8]I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them], to do you service.
\[9]And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied: and in all [things] I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and [so] will I keep [myself].
\[10]As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
\[11]Why? because I love you not? God knoweth.
\[12]But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them who desire occasion; that in what they glory, they may be found even as we.
\[13]For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
\[14]And no wonder; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
\[15]Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also are transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
\[16]I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
\[17]That which I speak, I speak [it] not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
\[18]Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
\[19]For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye [yourselves] are wise.
\[20]For ye suffer, if a man bringeth you into bondage, if a man devoureth [you], if a man taketh [from you], if a man exalteth himself, if a man smiteth you on the face.
\[21]I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. But in whatever respect any is bold, (I speak foolishly) I am bold also.
\[22]Are they Hebrews? so [am] I. Are they Israelites? so [am] I. Are they the offspring of Abraham? so [am] I.
\[23]Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am] more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.
\[24]From the Jews five times I received forty [stripes] save one.
\[25]Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
\[26][In] journeyings often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils by [my own] countrymen, [in] perils by the heathen, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren;
\[27]In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
\[28]Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
\[29]Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is made to fall into sin, and I burn not?
\[30]If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.
\[31]The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

t is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
\[2]I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such one caught up to the third heaven.
\[3]And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
\[4]That he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
\[5]Of such one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.
\[6]For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but [now] I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or [what] he heareth from me.
\[7]And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
\[8]For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
\[9]And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
\[10]Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
\[11]I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing am I behind the very greatest apostles, though I am nothing.
\[12]Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
\[13]For what is that in which ye were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
\[14]Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
\[15]And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.
\[16]But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
\[17]Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?
\[18]I desired Titus, and with [him] I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? [walked we] not in the same steps?
\[19]Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edification.
\[20]For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found by you such as ye would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
\[21][And] lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you, and I shall bewail many who have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness, and lewdness, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.

\[2]I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them who heretofore have sinned, and to all others, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
\[3]Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but is mighty in you.
\[4]For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.
\[5]Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye are reprobates?
\[6]But I trust that ye will know that we are not reprobates.
\[7]Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we should be as reprobates.
\[8]For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
\[9]For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your perfection.
\[10]Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
\[11]Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
\[12]Greet one another with a holy kiss.
\[13]All the saints salute you.

\[5]To whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\[6]I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel:
\[7]Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
\[8]But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.
\[9]As we said before, so I say now again, If any [man] preacheth any other gospel to you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
\[10]For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
\[11]But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
\[12]For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
\[13]For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it;
\[14]And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
\[15]But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,
\[16]To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
\[17]Neither did I go to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me: but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
\[18]Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
\[19]But I saw no other of the apostles, save James the Lord's brother.
\[20]Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.
\[21]Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
\[22]And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ:

hen fourteen years after I went again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with [me] also.
\[2]And I went by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain.
\[3]But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
\[4]And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
\[5]To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
\[6]But of these, who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed [to be somewhat], in conference added nothing to me:
\[7]But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as [the gospel] of the circumcision [was] to Peter;
\[8](For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me towards the Gentiles:)
\[9]And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we [should go] to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.
\[10]Only [they would] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
\[11]But when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
\[12]For before that certain came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.
\[13]And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
\[14]But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
\[15]We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
\[16]Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
\[17]But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of sin? By no means.
\[18]For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
\[19]For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live to God.
\[20]I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
\[21]I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness is [attainable] by the law, then Christ hath died in vain.

 foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
\[2]This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
\[3]Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
\[4]Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if [it is] yet in vain.
\[5]He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he this] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
\[6]Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
\[7]Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
\[8]And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.
\[9]So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
\[10]For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curse: for it is written, Accursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
\[11]But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
\[12]And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live by them.
\[13]Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Accursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:
\[14]That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
\[15]Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it is but a man's covenant, yet [if it is] confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth to it.
\[16]Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
\[17]And this I say, [that] the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect.
\[18]For if the inheritance [is] by the law, [it is] no more by promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.
\[19]What purpose then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
\[20]Now a mediator is not a [mediator] of one; but God is one.
\[21][Is] the law then against the promises of God? By no means: for if there had been a law given which could give life, verily righteousness would have been by the law.
\[22]But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
\[23]But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
\[24]Wherefore the law was our school-master [to bring us] to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
\[25]But after faith is come, we are no longer under a school-master.
\[26]For ye are all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
\[27]For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.
\[28]There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

ow I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he is lord of all;
\[2]But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.
\[3]Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
\[4]But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
\[5]To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
\[6]And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
\[7]Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
\[8]However then, when ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no gods.
\[9]But now, after ye have known God, or rather are known by God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which ye desire again to be in bondage?

\[14]And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.
\[15]What then was the blessedness ye spoke of; for I bear you testimony, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
\[16]Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
\[17]They zealously affect you, [but] not well; for, they would exclude you, that ye may affect them.
\[18]But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.
\[19]My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in you,
\[20]I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
\[21]Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
\[22]For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman.
\[23]But he [who was] of the bond-woman, was born according to the flesh; but he of the free-woman [was] by promise.
\[24]Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
\[25]For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
\[26]But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
\[27]For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she who hath a husband.
\[28]Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
\[29]But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to the Spirit, even so [it is] now.
\[30]Nevertheless, what saith the scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her son: for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.

\[11]And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then hath the offense of the cross ceased.
\[12]I would they were even cut off who trouble you.
\[13]For, brethren, ye have been called to liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
\[14]For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
\[15]But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one by another.
\[16][This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
\[17]For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
\[18]But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
\[19]Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these], Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
\[20]Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
\[21]Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
\[22]But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
\[23]Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
\[24]And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.

\[12]As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

\[20]Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],
\[21]Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:

\[2]In which in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
\[3]Among whom also we all had our manner of life in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
\[4]But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,
\[5]Even when we were dead in sins, hath made us alive together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
\[6]And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places], in Christ Jesus:
\[7]That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness towards us, through Christ Jesus.
\[8]For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:
\[9]Not by works, lest any man should boast.
\[10]For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
\[11]Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
\[12]That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
\[13]But now, in Christ Jesus, ye, who formerly were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
\[14]For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];
\[15]Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances: to make in himself of two one new man, [so] making peace;
\[16]And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having by it slain the enmity:
\[17]And came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
\[18]For through him we both have an access by one Spirit to the Father.
\[19]Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
\[20]And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-[stone];
\[21]In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth to a holy temple in the Lord:
\[22]In whom ye also are built together, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.

\[7]Of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.
\[8]To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
\[9]And to make all [men] see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:

\[14]For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\[15]Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
\[16]That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

\[18]May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and highth.

\[4][There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
\[5]One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
\[6]One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you all.
\[7]But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
\[8]Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.
\[9]Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
\[10]He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.
\[11]And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
\[12]For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
\[13]Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:
\[14]That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive:
\[15]But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head, [even] Christ:
\[16]From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.
\[17]This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
\[18]Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
\[19]Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
\[20]But ye have not so learned Christ;
\[21]If indeed ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
\[22]That ye put off concerning the former manner of life the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts:
\[23]And be renewed in the Spirit of your mind;
\[24]And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
\[25]Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
\[26]Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
\[27]Neither give place to the devil.
\[28]Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
\[29]Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.
\[30]And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption.
\[31]Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

\[3]But lewdness and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
\[4]Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
\[5]For this ye know, that no lewd, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
\[6]Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

\[13]But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light: for whatever doth make manifest is light.
\[14]Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ will give thee light.
\[15]See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
\[16]Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
\[17]Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord [is].
\[18]And be not drunk with wine, in which is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
\[19]Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
\[20]Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\[21]Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
\[22]Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
\[23]For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the Savior of the body.
\[24]Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.
\[25]Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
\[26]That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
\[27]That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
\[28]So ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.
\[29]For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
\[30]For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
\[31]For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
\[32]This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

aul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
\[2]Grace [be] to you, and peace, from God our Father and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[3]I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
\[4]Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
\[5]For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
\[6]Being confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you, will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:
\[7]Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
\[8]For God is my witness, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
\[9]And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;
\[10]That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ;
\[11]Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
\[12]But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;
\[13]So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];
\[14]And many of the brethren in the Lord, becoming confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
\[15]Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife; and some also from good will.
\[16]The one preach Christ from contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
\[17]But the other from love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.
\[18]What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.
\[19]For I know that this will turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
\[20]According to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
\[21]For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.
\[22]But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.
\[23]For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
\[24]Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.
\[25]And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
\[26]That your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.
\[27]Only let your manner of life be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
\[28]And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
\[29]For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
\[30]Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, [and] now hear [to be] in me.

\[3][Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vain glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
\[4]Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
\[5]Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
\[6]Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
\[7]But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
\[8]And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.
\[9]Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
\[10]That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] on earth, and [things] under the earth;
\[11]And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
\[12]Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
\[13]For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.
\[14]Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
\[15]That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
\[16]Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.
\[17]And if I am even offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
\[18]For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
\[19]But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
\[20]For I have no man like-minded, who will naturally care for your state.
\[21]For all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
\[22]But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
\[23]Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
\[24]But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
\[25]Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow-soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
\[26]For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he was sick.
\[27]For indeed he was sick nigh to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
\[28]I sent him therefore the more speedily, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
\[29]Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
\[30]Because for the work of Christ he was nigh to death, not regarding his life, to supply the want of your service towards me.

\[6]Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; with respect to the righteousness which is by the law, blameless.
\[7]But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
\[8]Yes doubtless, and I count all things [to be] loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [to be] dung, that I may win Christ,
\[9]And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:
\[10]That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;
\[11]If by any means I may attain to the resurrection of the dead.
\[12]Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I pursue, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended by Christ Jesus.
\[13]Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those things which are before,
\[14]I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
\[15]Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye are otherwise minded, God will reveal even this to you.
\[16]Nevertheless, to what we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
\[17]Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them who walk so as ye have us for an example.
\[18](For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
\[19]Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
\[20]For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:

\[12]Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
\[13]Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his beloved Son:
\[14]In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the forgiveness of sins:
\[15]Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature:
\[16]For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are upon earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
\[17]And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
\[18]And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all [things] he may have the pre-eminence.
\[19]For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fullness dwell;
\[20]And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, [I say], whether [they are] things on earth, or things in heaven.
\[21]And you, that were formerly alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled,
\[22]In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight:
\[23]If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [are] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which hath been preached to every creature which is under heaven; of which I Paul am made a minister;
\[24]Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:
\[25]Of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;
\[26][Even] the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
\[27]To whom God would make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
\[28]Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

\[2]That their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
\[3]In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
\[4]And this I say, lest any man should deceive you with enticing words.
\[5]For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
\[6]As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him:
\[7]Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.
\[8]Beware lest any man make a prey of you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
\[9]For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
\[10]And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power:
\[11]In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:
\[12]Buried with him in baptism, in which also ye are raised with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.
\[13]And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he made alive together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
\[14]Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
\[15][And] having despoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
\[16]Let no man therefore judge you in food, or in drink, or in respect of a holy-day, or or the new-moon, or of the sabbaths:
\[17]Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.
\[18]Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
\[19]And not holding the head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
\[20]Wherefore, if ye are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
\[21](Touch not; taste not; handle not;
\[22]Which all are to perish with the using;) according to the commandments and doctrines of men?

or yourselves, brethren, know our entrance to you, that it was not in vain:
\[2]But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as ye know, at Phillippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.
\[3]For our exhortation [was] not from deceit, nor from impurity, nor in guile;
\[4]But as we were allowed by God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.
\[5]For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God [is] witness:
\[6]Nor from men sought we glory, neither from you, nor [yet] from others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
\[7]But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
\[8]So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear to us.
\[9]For ye remember, brethren, our labor and toil: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.
\[10]Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily, and justly, and unblamably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
\[11]As ye know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children,
\[12]That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you into his kingdom and glory.
\[13]For this cause also we thank God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
\[14]For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things from your own countrymen, even as they [have] from the Jews:
\[15]Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
\[16]Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
\[17]But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
\[18]Wherefore we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
\[19]For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

\[12]That ye may walk honestly towards them that are without, and [that] ye may have need of nothing.
\[13]But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope.
\[14]For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
\[15]For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive [and] remain to the coming of the Lord shall not precede them who are asleep.
\[16]For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

\[4]One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
\[5](For if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
\[6]Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
\[7]Moreover, he must have a good report of them who are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

\[9]Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

\[14]But without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
\[15]For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldst receive him for ever;
\[16]Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
\[17]If thou accountest me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

\[19]I Paul have written [it] with my own hand, I will repay [it]: although I do not say to thee that thou owest to me even thy own self besides.
\[20]Yes, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
\[21]Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
\[22]But at the same time prepare me also a lodging; for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.

od, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,
\[2]Hath in these last days spoken to us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
\[3]Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
\[4]Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
\[5]For to which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
\[6]And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
\[7]And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
\[8]But to the Son, [he saith], Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of thy kingdom.
\[9]Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, [even] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
\[10]And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the works of thy hands.

\[12]And as a vesture wilt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

herefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.
\[2]For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;
\[3]How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard [him];
\[4]God also bearing [them] testimony, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?
\[5]For to the angels he hath not put in subjection the world to come, concerning which we speak.
\[6]But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
\[7]Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honor, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
\[8]Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not made subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.
\[9]But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
\[10]For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
\[11]For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
\[12]Saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise to thee.
\[13]And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me.
\[14]Since then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
\[15]And deliver them, who, through fear of death, were all their life-time subject to bondage.
\[16]For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.
\[17]Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like [his] brethren; that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
\[18]For in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.

herefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
\[2]Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.
\[3]For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath built the house, hath more honor than the house.
\[4]For every house is built by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.
\[5]And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were [afterwards] to be spoken.
\[6]But Christ as a son over his own house: whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.
\[7]Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye will hear his voice,
\[8]Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
\[9]When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
\[10]Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.
\[11]So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
\[12]Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
\[13]But exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
\[14]For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;
\[15]While it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
\[16]For some, when they had heard, did provoke: yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
\[17]But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
\[18]And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

et us therefore fear, lest a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
\[2]For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].
\[3]For we who have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
\[4]For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God rested the seventh day from all his works.
\[5]And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.
\[6]Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not because of unbelief:
\[7](Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To-day, after so long a time; as it is said, To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
\[8]For if Jesus had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day.
\[9]There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
\[10]For he that hath entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.)
\[11]Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
\[12]For the word of God [is] living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
\[13]Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
\[14]Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.
\[15]For we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but who was in all points tempted as [we are], [yet] without sin.

herefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God,

\[3]And this will we do, if God permit.
\[4]For [it is] impossible for those who have been once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit.
\[5]And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
\[6]If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.
\[7]For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs fit for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:
\[8]But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh to cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.
\[9]But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
\[10]For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have shown towards his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
\[11]And we desire every one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:
\[12]That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
\[13]For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
\[14]Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
\[15]And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
\[16]For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all contradiction.
\[17]Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:
\[18]That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
\[19]Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the vail;

or this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
\[2]To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
\[3]Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like to the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
\[4]Now consider how great this man [was], to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
\[5]And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they come from the loins of Abraham:
\[6]But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
\[7]And without all contradiction the less is blessed by the better.
\[8]And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is testified that he liveth.
\[9]And as I may say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
\[10]For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
\[11]If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
\[12]For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
\[13]For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
\[14]For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang from Judah; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
\[15]And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
\[16]Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
\[17]For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
\[18]For there is verily a disannulling of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and unprofitableness.
\[19]For the law made nothing perfect, but the introduction of a better hope [did]; by which we draw nigh to God.
\[20]And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:
\[21](For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath, by him that said to him, The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
\[22]By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
\[23]And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
\[24]But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
\[25]Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
\[26]For such a high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
\[27]Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

ow of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
\[2]A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
\[3]For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man should have somewhat also to offer.
\[4]For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, seeing there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
\[5]Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See (saith he) [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee in the mount.
\[6]But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
\[7]For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for the second.
\[8]For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
\[9]Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
\[10]For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
\[11]And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
\[12]For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
\[13]In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and groweth old [is] ready to vanish away.

hen verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
\[2]For there was a tabernacle made; the first, in which [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the show-bread; which is called the sanctuary.
\[3]And after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
\[4]Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid around with gold, in which [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
\[5]And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
\[6]Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God]:
\[7]But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:
\[8]The Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was yet standing:
\[9]Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
\[10][Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.
\[11]But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
\[12]Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood; he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].
\[13]For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctify to the purifying of the flesh:
\[14]How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
\[15]And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they who are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
\[16]For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
\[17]For a testament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
\[18]Hence even the first [testament] was not dedicated without blood.
\[19]For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book and all the people,
\[20]Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined to you.
\[21]Moreover, he sprinkled likewise with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
\[22]And almost all things are by the law cleansed with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
\[23][It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
\[24]For Christ hath not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
\[25]Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
\[26]For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
\[27]And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:
\[28]So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him he will appear the second time without sin to salvation.

or the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers to [them] perfect.
\[2]For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshipers once cleansed, would have had no more conscience of sins.
\[3]But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of sins every year.
\[4]For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
\[5]Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
\[6]In burnt-offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
\[7]Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written concerning me,) to do thy will, O God.
\[8]Above, when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt-offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldst not, neither hadst pleasure [in them]; which are offered by the law;
\[9]Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
\[10]By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].
\[11]And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
\[12]But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God;
\[13]From henceforth waiting till his enemies are made his footstool.
\[14]For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
\[15][Of this] the Holy Spirit also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
\[16]This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
\[17]And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
\[18]Now where remission of these [is], [there is] no more offering for sin.
\[19]Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
\[20]By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh;
\[21]And [having] a high priest over the house of God;
\[22]Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
\[23]Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; for he [is] faithful that promised:
\[24]And let us consider one another to excite to love and to good works:
\[25]Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
\[26]For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
\[27]But a certain fearful apprehension of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
\[28]He that despised Moses' law, died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
\[29]Of how much more severe punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite to the Spirit of grace?
\[30]For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.
\[31][It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
\[32]But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
\[33]Partly, while ye were made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while ye became companions of them that were so used.
\[34]For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the seizing of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
\[35]Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.
\[36]For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.
\[37]For yet a little while, and he that is coming will come, and will not tarry.
\[38]Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] shall draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

\[9]By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a foreign country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
\[10]For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.
\[11]Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
\[12]Therefore there sprang even from one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea-shore innumerable.
\[13]These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
\[14]For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
\[15]And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came, they might have had opportunity to return.
\[16]But now they desire a better [country], that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.
\[17]By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only-begotten [son],
\[18]Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
\[19]Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
\[20]By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
\[21]By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshiped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.
\[22]By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
\[23]By faith Moses when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
\[24]By faith Moses, when he had come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
\[25]Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
\[26]Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.
\[27]By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
\[28]Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the first-born should touch them.
\[29]By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians essaying to do were drowned.
\[30]By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encompassed seven days.
\[31]By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, as she had received the spies with peace.
\[32]And what shall I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthah, [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:
\[33]Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
\[34]Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
\[35]Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
\[36]And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, and, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
\[37]They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
\[38](Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.
\[39]And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
\[40]God having provided some better [thing] for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

herefore, seeing we also are encompassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
\[2]Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
\[3]For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
\[4]Ye have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.
\[5]And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh to you as to children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked by him:
\[6]For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
\[7]If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons: for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
\[8]But if ye are without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.
\[9]Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected [us], and we gave [them] reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
\[10]For they verily for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure; but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness.
\[11]Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them who are exercised by it.
\[12]Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
\[13]And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
\[14]Follow peace with all [men], and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
\[15]Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble [you], and by it many be defiled;
\[16]Lest there [be] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birth-right.
\[17]For ye know that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
\[18]For ye are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and to darkness, and tempest,
\[19]And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] they that heard, entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
\[20](For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
\[21]And so terrible was the sight, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble:)
\[22]But ye are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
\[23]To the general assembly and church of the first-born, who are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
\[24]And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than [that of] Abel.
\[25]See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more [shall not] we [escape], if we turn away from him that [speaketh] from heaven:
\[26]Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
\[27]And this [word], Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
\[28]Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.
\[29]For our God [is] a consuming fire.

\[15]By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips, giving thanks to his name.

\[17]Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitable for you.
\[18]Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
\[19]But I beseech [you] the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.

ames, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
\[2]My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.
\[3]Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
\[4]But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
\[5]If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given to him.
\[6]But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
\[7]For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.
\[8]A man unsettled in his opinions [is] unstable in all his ways.
\[9]Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
\[10]But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
\[11]For the sun hath no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and its flower falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
\[12]Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
\[13]Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
\[14]But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.
\[15]Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
\[16]Do not err, my beloved brethren.
\[17]Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
\[18]Of his own will he hath begotten us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.
\[19]Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
\[20]For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
\[21]Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
\[22]But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
\[23]For if any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
\[24]For he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and immediately forgetteth what manner of man he was.
\[25]But he who looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [in it], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
\[26]If any man among you seemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain.
\[27]Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.

y brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.
\[2]For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
\[3]And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say to him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
\[4]Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
\[5]Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
\[6]But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment-seats?
\[7]Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
\[8]If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:
\[9]But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
\[10]For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.
\[11]For he that said, Do not commit adultery; said also, Do not kill. Now if thou committest no adultery, yet if thou killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
\[12]So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
\[13]For he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shown no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
\[14]What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man sayeth he hath faith, and hath not works? can faith save him?
\[15]If a brother or sister is naked, and destitute of daily food,
\[16]And one of you sayeth to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?
\[17]Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
\[18]Also a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.
\[19]Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and tremble.
\[20]But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
\[21]Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
\[22]Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
\[23]And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
\[24]Ye see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
\[25]Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?

y brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
\[2]For in many things we all offend. If any man offendeth not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.
\[3]Behold, we put bits in the mouths of horses, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
\[4]Behold also the ships, which though they are so great, and [are] driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a very small helm, withersoever the governor willeth.
\[5]Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
\[6]And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire from hell.
\[7]For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of animals in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:
\[8]But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
\[9]With this we bless God, even the Father; and with this we curse men, who are made after the similitude of God.
\[10]Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
\[11]Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter?
\[12]Can the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries? or a vine, figs? so no fountain [can] yield both salt water and fresh.
\[13]Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show by a good deportment his works with meekness of wisdom.
\[14]But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
\[15]This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, demoniacal.
\[16]For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work.
\[17]But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

\[12]But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea, be yea: and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
\[13]Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him sing psalms.
\[14]Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
\[15]And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he hath committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
\[16]Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much.
\[17]Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
\[18]And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.
\[19]Brethren, if any one of you should err from the truth, and one should convert him;

\[12]To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they ministered the things which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.
\[13]Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
\[14]As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:
\[15]But as he who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of deportment.

\[20]Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you,
\[21]Who by him do believe in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
\[22]Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with a pure heart fervently:
\[23]Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.
\[24]For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and its flower falleth away:

\[10]Who in time past [were] not a people, but [are] now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
\[11]Dearly beloved, I beseech [you] as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
\[12]Having your manner of life honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by [your] good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
\[13]Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;
\[14]Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well.
\[15]For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
\[16]As free, and not using [your] liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
\[17]Honor all [men]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
\[18]Servants, [be] subject to [your] masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
\[19]For this [is] thank-worthy, if a man for conscience towards God endureth grief, suffering wrongfully.
\[20]For what glory [is it], if, when ye are buffeted for your faults, ye bear it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer [for it], ye bear it patiently, this [is] acceptable with God.
\[21]For even to this were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:
\[22]Who committed no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
\[23]Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that judgeth righteously:
\[24]Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.
\[25]For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

ikewise, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the deportment of the wives;
\[2]While they behold your chaste manner of life [coupled] with fear.
\[3]Whose adorning let it not be that outward [adorning] of plaiting the hair, and of wearing gold, or of putting on apparel;
\[4]But [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, [even the ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
\[5]For after this manner in former times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
\[6]Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
\[7]Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
\[8]Finally, [be ye] all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love as brethren, [be] pitiful, [be] courteous:
\[9]Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but on the contrary, blessing; knowing that ye are called to this, that ye should inherit a blessing.
\[10]For he that will love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
\[11]Let him shun evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.
\[12]For the eyes of the Lord [are] over the righteous, and his ears [are open] to their prayers: but the face of the Lord [is] against them that do evil.
\[13]And who [is] he that will harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good?
\[14]But if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy [are ye]: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
\[15]But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and [be] ready always to [give] an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.
\[16]Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good deportment in Christ.
\[17]For [it is] better, if the will of God is so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.
\[18]For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit:
\[19]By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;
\[20]Who formerly were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.
\[21]The like figure to which, [even] baptism, doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
\[22]Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels, and authorities, and powers being made subject to him.

orasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
\[2]That he no longer should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
\[3]For the time past of [our] life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
\[4]In which they think it strange that ye run not with [them] to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of [you]:
\[5]Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
\[6]For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
\[7]But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch to prayer.
\[8]And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity will cover a multitude of sins.
\[9]Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
\[10]As every man hath received the gift, [even so] minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
\[11]If any man speaketh [let him speak] as the oracles of God; if any man ministereth [let him do it] as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\[12]Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:
\[13]But rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
\[14]If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy [are ye]; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
\[15]But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or [as] an evil-doer, or as a busy-body in other men's matters.
\[16]Yet if [any man suffereth] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
\[17]For the time [is come] that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if [it] first [beginneth] at us, what will [be] the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?
\[18]And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?
\[19]Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls [to him] in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.

imon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:
\[2]Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
\[3]According as his divine power hath given to us all things that [pertain] to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
\[4]Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
\[5]And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
\[6]And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
\[7]And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
\[8]For if these things be in you, and abound, they make [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[9]But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purified from his old sins.
\[10]Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
\[11]For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
\[12]Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know [them], and are established in the present truth.
\[13]Indeed, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance;
\[14]Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shown me.
\[15]Moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able, after my decease, to have these things always in remembrance.
\[16]For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
\[17]For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\[18]And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him on the holy mount.
\[19]We have also a more sure word of prophecy; to which ye do well that ye take heed, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:
\[20]Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
\[21]For prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke [as they were] moved by the Holy Spirit.

ut there were false prophets also among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will privately bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
\[2]And many will follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth will be evil spoken of.
\[3]And through covetousness they will with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
\[4]For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;
\[5]And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person], a preacher of righteousness, bringing the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
\[6]And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an example to those that afterwards should live ungodly lives.
\[7]And delivered just Lot, grieved with the habitual lewdness of the wicked:
\[8](For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, grieved [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)
\[9]The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:
\[10]But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous [are they], self-willed; they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
\[11]Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.
\[12]But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption:
\[13]And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the day-time. Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
\[14]Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: they have a heart exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
\[15]Who have forsaken the right way, and gone astray, following the way of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
\[16]But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice, forbad the madness of the prophet.
\[17]These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
\[18]For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that had quite escaped from them who live in error.
\[19]While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for by whom a man is overcome, by the same is he brought into bondage.
\[20]For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
\[21]For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it], to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
\[22]But it hath happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog [is] turned to his own vomit again; and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.

his second epistle, beloved, I now write to you; in [both] which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
\[2]That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:
\[3]Knowing this first, that there will come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
\[4]And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.
\[5]For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
\[6]By which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
\[7]But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved to fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
\[8]But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
\[9]The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
\[10]But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein will be burned up.
\[11][Seeing] then [that] all these things will be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy deportment and godliness,
\[12]Looking for and hasting to the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
\[13]Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwelleth righteousness.
\[14]Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found by him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
\[15]And account [that] the long-suffering of our Lord [is] salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, hath written to you;
\[16]As also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as [they do] also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
\[17]Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [these things] before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.
\[18]But grow in grace, and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him [be] glory both now and for ever. Amen.

\[3]And by this we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
\[4]He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
\[5]But whoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: by this we know that we are in him.
\[6]He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
\[7]Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
\[8]Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.
\[9]He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.
\[10]He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
\[11]But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes.
\[12]I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
\[13]I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
\[14]I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
\[15]Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the world. If any man loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
\[16]For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.
\[17]And the world passeth away, and the lust of it: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
\[18]Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist cometh, even now are there many antichrists; by which we know that it is the last time.
\[19]They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have continued with us: but [they went out], that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
\[20]But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
\[21]I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
\[22]Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.
\[23]Whoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [[but] he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also].
\[24]Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.
\[25]And this is the promise that he hath promised us, [even] eternal life.
\[26]These [things] have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.
\[27]But the anointing which ye have received from him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man should teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
\[28]And now, little children, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

\[8]He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
\[9]Whoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
\[10]In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.

\[15]Whoever hateth his brother, is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
\[16]By this we perceive the love [of God], because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren.
\[17]But he who hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels [of compassion] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
\[18]My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
\[19]And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
\[20]For if our heart condemneth us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
\[21]Beloved, if our heart doth not condemn us, [then] have we confidence towards God.
\[22]And whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
\[23]And this is his commandment; That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

\[8]He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.
\[9]In this was manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

\[11]Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

\[14]And we have seen and do testify, that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Savior of the world.
\[15]Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
\[16]And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love: and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.
\[17]In this is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
\[18]There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth, is not made perfect in love.
\[19]We love him, because he first loved us.
\[20]If a man sayeth, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen?

hoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten by him.
\[2]By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
\[3]For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.
\[4]For whatever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, [even] our faith.
\[5]Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
\[6]This is he that came by water and blood, [even] Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth testimony, because the Spirit is truth.
\[7]For there are three that bear testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.
\[8]And there are three that bear testimony on earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
\[9]If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater: for this is the testimony of God which he hath testified of his Son.
\[10]He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he hath not believed the testimony that God gave of his Son.
\[11]And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life: and this life is in his Son.
\[12]He that hath the Son, hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.
\[13]These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
\[14]And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
\[15]And if we know that he heareth us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired from him.
\[16]If any man shall see his brother sin a sin [which is] not to death, he shall ask, and he will give him life for them that sin not to death. There is a sin to death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
\[17]All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not to death.
\[18]We know that whoever is born of God, sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
\[19][And] we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
\[20]And we know that the Son of God hath come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

ude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, [and] called:
\[2]Mercy to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
\[3]Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you concerning the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort [you] that ye should earnestly contend for the faith, which was once delivered to the saints.
\[4]For certain men have crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[5]I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
\[6]And the angels who kept not their first state, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.
\[7]Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to impurity, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
\[8]Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
\[9]Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
\[10]But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
\[11]Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and run greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
\[12]These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds [they are] without water, carried about by winds; withered autumnal trees, without fruit, twice dead, plucked out by the roots;
\[13]Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
\[14]And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
\[15]To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have impiously committed, and of all their hard [speeches] which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
\[16]These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling [words], having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.
\[17]But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\[18]That they told you there would be mockers in the last time, who would walk after their own ungodly lusts.
\[19]These are they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
\[20]But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying by the Holy Spirit,
\[21]Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
\[22]And of some have compassion, making a difference:
\[23]And others save with fear, pulling [them] out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
\[24]Now to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
\[25]To God the only wise, our Savior, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

\[11]Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send [it] to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
\[12]And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
\[13]And in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
\[14]His head and [his] hairs [were] white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire;
\[15]And his feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
\[16]And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance [was] as the sun shineth in his strength.
\[17]And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:

\[3]And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not fainted.
\[4]Nevertheless, I have [somewhat] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
\[5]Remember therefore from whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.
\[6]But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

\[9]I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.
\[10]Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil will cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful to death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
\[11]He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; He that overcometh, shall not be hurt by the second death.

\[14]But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit lewdness.
\[15]So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
\[16]Repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
\[17]He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, he excepted, that receiveth [it].

\[20]Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit lewdness, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
\[21]And I gave her time to repent of her lewdness, and she repented not.
\[22]Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
\[23]And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.
\[24]But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, As many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you no other burden:
\[25]But that which ye have [already] hold fast till I come.
\[26]And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
\[27](And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:) even as I received of my Father.

\[12]Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, [be] to our God for ever and ever. Amen.
\[13]And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these that are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
\[14]And I said to him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
\[15]Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne will dwell among them.

\[7]The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
\[8]And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
\[9]And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
\[10]And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
\[11]And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died by the waters, because they were made bitter.

\[3]And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
\[4]And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men who have not the seal of God in their foreheads.

\[16]And the number of the army of the horsemen [was] two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
\[17]And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breast-plates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses [were] as the heads of lions: and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.

\[19]For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails [were] like to serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
\[20]And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:

\[6]Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double to her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double.
\[7]How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
\[8]Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] the Lord God who judgeth her.
\[9]And the kings of the earth, who have committed lewdness and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
\[10]Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
\[11]And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
\[12]The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all vessels of ivory, and all vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
\[13]And cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
\[14]And the fruits that thy soul lusted after have departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly have departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
\[15]The merchants of these things who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off, for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
\[16]And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
\[17]For in one hour so great riches is come to naught. And every ship-master, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
\[18]And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city is] like this great city!
\[19]And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her opulence! for in one hour is she made desolate.
\[20]Rejoice over her [thou] heaven, and [ye] holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.
\[21]And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be no more found.
\[22]And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be no more heard in thee; and no artificer, of whatever craft [he be], shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be no more heard in thee;
\[23]And the light of a candle shall shine no more in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
\[24]And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.

nd after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, Alleluia: Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:
\[2]For true and righteous [are] his judgments: for he hath judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her lewdness, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
\[3]And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
\[4]And the four and twenty elders and the four living beings fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
\[5]And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
\[6]And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
\[7]Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
\[8]And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
\[9]And he saith to me, Write, Blessed [are] they who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me, These are the true sayings of God.
\[10]And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
\[11]And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon him [was] called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
\[12]His eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his head [were] many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
\[13]And he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called, The Word of God.
\[14]And the armies [which were] in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
\[15]And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
\[16]And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
\[17]And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, and assemble yourselves to the supper of the great God;
\[18]That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all [men], [both] free and bond, both small and great.
\[19]And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, assembled to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
\[20]And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
\[21]And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which [sword] proceedeth out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

nd I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
\[2]And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.
\[3]And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled; and after that he must be loosed a little season.
\[4]And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them: and [I saw] the souls of them that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
\[5]But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This [is] the first resurrection.
\[6]Blessed and holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
\[7]And when the thousand years have expired, Satan shall be loosed from his prison,
\[8]And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.
\[9]And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
\[10]And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
\[11]And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
\[12]And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.
\[13]And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
\[14]And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
\[15]And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

nd I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away; and there was no more sea.
\[2]And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
\[3]And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them, [and be] their God.
\[4]And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things have passed away.
\[5]And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
\[6]And he said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.
\[7]He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
\[8]But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and lewd men, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
\[9]And there came to me one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.
\[10]And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
\[11]Having the glory of God: and her light [was] like to a stone most precious, even like a jasper-stone, clear as crystal;
\[12]And had a wall great and high, [and] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on them, which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
\[13]On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
\[14]And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
\[15]And he that talked with me, had a golden reed to measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.
\[16]And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the hight of it are equal.
\[17]And he measured the wall of it a hundred [and] forty four cubits, [according to] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
\[18]And the building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold, like clear glass.
\[19]And the foundations of the wall of the city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation [was] jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
\[20]The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprase; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
\[21]And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl; and the street of the city [was] pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
\[22]And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
\[23]And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God enlightened it, and the Lamb [is] the light of it.
\[24]And the nations of them who are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.
\[25]And the gates of it shall not be shut by day: for there shall be no night there.
\[26]And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
\[27]And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither [whatever] worketh abomination, or [maketh] a lie; but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

\[2]In the midst of the street of it, and on each side of the river, [was there] the tree of life, which bore twelve [kinds of] fruits, [and] yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] for the healing of the nations.
\[3]And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
\[4]And they shall see his face; and his name [shall be] in their foreheads.
\[5]And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

\[7]Behold, I come quickly: blessed [is] he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.
\[8]And I John saw these things, and heard [them]. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
\[9]Then saith he to me, See [thou do it] not: for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the sayings of this book: worship God.
\[10]And he saith to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
\[11]He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
\[12]And behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give to every man according as his work shall be.
\[13]I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
\[14]Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
\[15]For without [are] dogs, and sorcerers, and lewd men, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loveth and maketh a lie.
\[16]I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, [and] the bright and morning-star.
\[17]And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth, say, Come. And let him that is thirsty, come: And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
\[18]For I testify to every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book:
\[19]And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.
\[20]He who testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
\[21]The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.
