he book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
\[2]Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brothers;
\[3]And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
\[4]And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
\[5]And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
\[6]And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
\[7]And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
\[8]And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
\[9]And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
\[10]And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
\[11]And Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
\[12]And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
\[13]And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
\[14]And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
\[15]And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
\[16]And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\[17]So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.
\[18]Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
\[19]Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.
\[20]But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take to you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
\[21]And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
\[22]Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
\[23]Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
\[24]Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:
\[25]And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

ow when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
\[2]Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
\[3]When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
\[4]And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
\[5]And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
\[6]And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
\[7]Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
\[8]And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
\[9]When they had heard the king, they departed; and, see, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
\[10]When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
\[11]And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.
\[12]And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
\[13]And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be you there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
\[14]When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
\[15]And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
\[16]Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
\[17]Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
\[18]In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
\[19]But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\[20]Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.
\[21]And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
\[22]But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
\[23]And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

n those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
\[2]And saying, Repent you: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\[3]For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\[4]And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
\[5]Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,
\[6]And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
\[7]But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\[8]Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
\[9]And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
\[10]And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\[11]I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:
\[12]Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
\[13]Then comes Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him.
\[14]But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?
\[15]And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
\[16]And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:
\[17]And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

hen was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
\[2]And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.
\[3]And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
\[4]But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
\[5]Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,
\[6]And said to him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.
\[7]Jesus said to him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.
\[8]Again, the devil takes him up into an exceeding high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
\[9]And said to him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.
\[10]Then said Jesus to him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.
\[11]Then the devil leaves him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him.
\[12]Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
\[13]And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
\[14]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
\[15]The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
\[16]The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
\[17]From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\[18]And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
\[19]And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
\[20]And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
\[21]And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
\[22]And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
\[23]And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
\[24]And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
\[25]And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

nd seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came to him:
\[2]And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
\[3]Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\[4]Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
\[5]Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
\[6]Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
\[7]Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
\[8]Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
\[9]Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
\[10]Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\[11]Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
\[12]Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
\[13]You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
\[14]You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
\[15]Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all that are in the house.
\[16]Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
\[17]Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
\[18]For truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass, one stroke or one pronunciation mark shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
\[19]Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\[20]For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\[21]You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
\[22]But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
\[23]Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has ought against you;
\[24]Leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
\[25]Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
\[26]Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out there, till you have paid the uttermost farthing.
\[27]You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:
\[28]But I say to you, That whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
\[29]And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.
\[30]And if your right hand offend you, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.
\[31]It has been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce:
\[32]But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.
\[33]Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:
\[34]But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
\[35]Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
\[36]Neither shall you swear by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.
\[37]But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatever is more than these comes of evil.
\[38]You have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
\[39]But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
\[40]And if any man will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.
\[41]And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.
\[42]Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you turn not you away.
\[43]You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.
\[44]But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which spitefully use you, and persecute you;
\[45]That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
\[46]For if you love them which love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans the same?
\[47]And if you salute your brothers only, what do you more than others? do not even the publicans so?
\[48]Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

ake heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
\[2]Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.
\[3]But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:
\[4]That your alms may be in secret: and your Father which sees in secret himself shall reward you openly.
\[5]And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.
\[6]But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.
\[7]But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
\[8]Be not you therefore like to them: for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask him.
\[9]After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.
\[10]Your kingdom come, Your will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
\[11]Give us this day our daily bread.
\[12]And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
\[13]And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
\[14]For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
\[15]But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
\[16]Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.
\[17]But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;
\[18]That you appear not to men to fast, but to your Father which is in secret: and your Father, which sees in secret, shall reward you openly.
\[19]Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
\[20]But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
\[21]For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\[22]The light of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light.
\[23]But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!
\[24]No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
\[25]Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
\[26]Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
\[27]Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?
\[28]And why take you thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
\[29]And yet I say to you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\[30]Why, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
\[31]Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
\[32](For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.
\[33]But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.
\[34]Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.

udge not, that you be not judged.
\[2]For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.
\[3]And why behold you the mote that is in your brother's eye, but consider not the beam that is in your own eye?
\[4]Or how will you say to your brother, Let me pull out the mote out of your eye; and, behold, a beam is in your own eye?
\[5]You hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye; and then shall you see clearly to cast out the mote out of your brother's eye.
\[6]Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
\[7]Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:
\[8]For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.
\[9]Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
\[10]Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
\[11]If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
\[12]Therefore all things whatever you would that men should do to you, do you even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
\[13]Enter you in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
\[14]Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leads to life, and few there be that find it.
\[15]Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
\[16]You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
\[17]Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.
\[18]A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
\[19]Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\[20]Why by their fruits you shall know them.
\[21]Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven.
\[22]Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?
\[23]And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.
\[24]Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:
\[25]And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell not: for it was founded on a rock.
\[26]And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house on the sand:
\[27]And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
\[28]And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:
\[29]For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

\[3]And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
\[4]And Jesus said to him, See you tell no man; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
\[5]And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,
\[6]And saying, Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
\[7]And Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.
\[8]The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
\[9]For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
\[10]When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\[11]And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
\[12]But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\[13]And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so be it done to you. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.
\[14]And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.
\[15]And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them.
\[16]When the even was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:
\[17]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.
\[18]Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side.
\[19]And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.
\[20]And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
\[21]And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\[22]But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.
\[23]And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
\[24]And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
\[25]And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.
\[26]And he said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
\[27]But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
\[28]And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
\[29]And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?
\[30]And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.
\[31]So the devils sought him, saying, If you cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
\[32]And he said to them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.
\[33]And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.
\[34]And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they sought him that he would depart out of their coasts.

nd he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.
\[2]And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.
\[3]And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.
\[4]And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Why think you evil in your hearts?
\[5]For whether is easier, to say, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?
\[6]But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.
\[7]And he arose, and departed to his house.
\[8]But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled, and glorified God, which had given such power to men.
\[9]And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
\[10]And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
\[11]And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why eats your Master with publicans and sinners?
\[12]But when Jesus heard that, he said to them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
\[13]But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\[14]Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?
\[15]And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.
\[16]No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
\[17]Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runs out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.
\[18]While he spoke these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand on her, and she shall live.
\[19]And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
\[20]And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:
\[21]For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.
\[22]But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
\[23]And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
\[24]He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.
\[25]But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
\[26]And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
\[27]And when Jesus departed there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, You son of David, have mercy on us.
\[28]And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus said to them, Believe you that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.
\[29]Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you.
\[30]And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straightly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.
\[31]But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
\[32]As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.
\[33]And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
\[34]But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the prince of the devils.
\[35]And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
\[36]But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
\[37]Then said he to his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few;
\[38]Pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.

nd when he had called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
\[2]Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
\[3]Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
\[4]Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\[5]These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:
\[6]But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\[7]And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
\[8]Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.
\[9]Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
\[10]Nor money for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
\[11]And into whatever city or town you shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till you go there.
\[12]And when you come into an house, salute it.
\[13]And if the house be worthy, let your peace come on it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
\[14]And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
\[15]Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
\[16]Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
\[17]But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;
\[18]And you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
\[19]But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.
\[20]For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.
\[21]And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.
\[22]And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.
\[23]But when they persecute you in this city, flee you into another: for truly I say to you, You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
\[24]The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
\[25]It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?
\[26]Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
\[27]What I tell you in darkness, that speak you in light: and what you hear in the ear, that preach you on the housetops.
\[28]And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\[29]Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
\[30]But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
\[31]Fear you not therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows.
\[32]Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
\[33]But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.
\[34]Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
\[35]For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
\[36]And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.
\[37]He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\[38]And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.
\[39]He that finds his life shall lose it: and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it.
\[40]He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.
\[41]He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
\[42]And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

nd it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed there to teach and to preach in their cities.
\[2]Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
\[3]And said to him, Are you he that should come, or do we look for another?
\[4]Jesus answered and said to them, Go and show John again those things which you do hear and see:
\[5]The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
\[6]And blessed is he, whoever shall not be offended in me.
\[7]And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
\[8]But what went you out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
\[9]But what went you out for to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
\[10]For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.
\[11]Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\[12]And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
\[13]For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
\[14]And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
\[15]He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
\[16]But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,
\[17]And saying, We have piped to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you have not lamented.
\[18]For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.
\[19]The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.
\[20]Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:
\[21]Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\[22]But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
\[23]And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
\[24]But I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.
\[25]At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.
\[26]Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in your sight.
\[27]All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.
\[28]Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
\[29]Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.
\[30]For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

t that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.
\[2]But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold, your disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath day.
\[3]But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was an hungered, and they that were with him;
\[4]How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?
\[5]Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
\[6]But I say to you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.
\[7]But if you had known what this means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.
\[8]For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
\[9]And when he was departed there, he went into their synagogue:
\[10]And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
\[11]And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
\[12]How much then is a man better than a sheep? Why it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
\[13]Then said he to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.
\[14]Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.
\[15]But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
\[16]And charged them that they should not make him known:
\[17]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
\[18]Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.
\[19]He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
\[20]A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment to victory.
\[21]And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
\[22]Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.
\[23]And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?
\[24]But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.
\[25]And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
\[26]And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?
\[27]And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.
\[28]But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.
\[29]Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.
\[30]He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.
\[31]Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.
\[32]And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.
\[33]Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.
\[34]O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
\[35]A good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.
\[36]But I say to you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
\[37]For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.
\[38]Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.
\[39]But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:
\[40]For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
\[41]The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
\[42]The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
\[43]When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
\[44]Then he said, I will return into my house from where I came out; and when he is come, he finds it empty, swept, and garnished.
\[45]Then goes he, and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation.
\[46]While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.
\[47]Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak with you.
\[48]But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother?  and who are my brothers?
\[49]And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!
\[50]For whoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

he same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
\[2]And great multitudes were gathered together to him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
\[3]And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
\[4]And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
\[5]Some fell on stony places, where they had not much earth: and immediately they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
\[6]And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
\[7]And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
\[8]But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundred times, some sixty times, some thirty times.
\[9]Who has ears to hear, let him hear.
\[10]And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speak you to them in parables?
\[11]He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
\[12]For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.
\[13]Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
\[14]And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:
\[15]For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
\[16]But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
\[17]For truly I say to you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.
\[18]Hear you therefore the parable of the sower.
\[19]When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, then comes the wicked one, and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
\[20]But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
\[21]Yet has he not root in himself, but endures for a while: for when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, by and by he is offended.
\[22]He also that received seed among the thorns is he that hears the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\[23]But he that received seed into the good ground is he that hears the word, and understands it; which also bears fruit, and brings forth, some an hundred times, some sixty, some thirty.
\[24]Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man which sowed good seed in his field:
\[25]But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
\[26]But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
\[27]So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did not you sow good seed in your field? from where then has it tares?
\[28]He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Will you then that we go and gather them up?
\[29]But he said, No; lest while you gather up the tares, you root up also the wheat with them.
\[30]Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather you together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
\[31]Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
\[32]Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.
\[33]Another parable spoke he to them; The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
\[34]All these things spoke Jesus to the multitude in parables; and without a parable spoke he not to them:
\[35]That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
\[36]Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Declare to us the parable of the tares of the field.
\[37]He answered and said to them, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;
\[38]The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
\[39]The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
\[40]As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
\[41]The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
\[42]And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\[43]Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who has ears to hear, let him hear.
\[44]Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to treasure hid in a field; the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
\[45]Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
\[46]Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
\[47]Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
\[48]Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
\[49]So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
\[50]And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
\[51]Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They say to him, Yes, Lord.
\[52]Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed to the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.
\[53]And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed there.
\[54]And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
\[55]Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
\[56]And his sisters, are they not all with us? From where then has this man all these things?
\[57]And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.
\[58]And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

t that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
\[2]And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
\[3]For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
\[4]For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.
\[5]And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
\[6]But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
\[7]Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.
\[8]And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.
\[9]And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.
\[10]And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
\[11]And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
\[12]And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
\[13]When Jesus heard of it, he departed there by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
\[14]And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
\[15]And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
\[16]But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; give you them to eat.
\[17]And they say to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
\[18]He said, Bring them here to me.
\[19]And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\[20]And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
\[21]And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.
\[22]And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
\[23]And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
\[24]But the ship was now in the middle of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.
\[25]And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
\[26]And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
\[27]But straightway Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
\[28]And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be you, bid me come to you on the water.
\[29]And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
\[30]But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
\[31]And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?
\[32]And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
\[33]Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.
\[34]And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
\[35]And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought to him all that were diseased;
\[36]And sought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

hen came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
\[2]Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
\[3]But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
\[4]For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.
\[5]But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me;
\[6]And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
\[7]You hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
\[8]This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
\[9]But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
\[10]And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:
\[11]Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.
\[12]Then came his disciples, and said to him, Know you that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
\[13]But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.
\[14]Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
\[15]Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this parable.
\[16]And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding?
\[17]Do not you yet understand, that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
\[18]But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
\[19]For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
\[20]These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man.
\[21]Then Jesus went there, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
\[22]And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, you son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
\[23]But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and sought him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us.
\[24]But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\[25]Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
\[26]But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.
\[27]And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
\[28]Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it to you even as you will. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
\[29]And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
\[30]And great multitudes came to him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
\[31]So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
\[32]Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
\[33]And his disciples say to him, From where should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
\[34]And Jesus said to them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
\[35]And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
\[36]And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\[37]And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
\[38]And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
\[39]And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.

he Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.
\[2]He answered and said to them, When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.
\[3]And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O you hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky; but can you not discern the signs of the times?
\[4]A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
\[5]And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\[6]Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
\[7]And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
\[8]Which when Jesus perceived, he said to them, O you of little faith, why reason you among yourselves, because you have brought no bread?
\[9]Do you not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
\[10]Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
\[11]How is it that you do not understand that I spoke it not to you concerning bread, that you should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
\[12]Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
\[13]When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
\[14]And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
\[15]He said to them, But whom say you that I am?
\[16]And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
\[17]And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.
\[18]And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
\[19]And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\[20]Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
\[21]From that time forth began Jesus to show to his disciples, how that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
\[22]Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.
\[23]But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are an offense to me: for you mind not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
\[24]Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
\[25]For whoever will save his life shall lose it: and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
\[26]For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
\[27]For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
\[28]Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

nd after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,
\[2]And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
\[3]And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.
\[4]Then answered Peter, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you will, let us make here three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
\[5]While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.
\[6]And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
\[7]And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
\[8]And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
\[9]And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.
\[10]And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
\[11]And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.
\[12]But I say to you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
\[13]Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.
\[14]And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
\[15]Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for often he falls into the fire, and oft into the water.
\[16]And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.
\[17]Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him here to me.
\[18]And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.
\[19]Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
\[20]And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
\[21]However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.
\[22]And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
\[23]And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.  And they were exceeding sorry.
\[24]And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Does not your master pay tribute?
\[25]He said, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What think you, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?
\[26]Peter said to him, Of strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the children free.
\[27]Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go you to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a piece of money: that take, and give to them for me and you.

t the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
\[2]And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the middle of them,
\[3]And said, Truly I say to you, Except you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\[4]Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\[5]And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me.
\[6]But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
\[7]Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!
\[8]Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
\[9]And if your eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
\[10]Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
\[11]For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
\[12]How think you? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not leave the ninety and nine, and goes into the mountains, and seeks that which is gone astray?
\[13]And if so be that he find it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.
\[14]Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
\[15]Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.
\[16]But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
\[17]And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.
\[18]Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\[19]Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
\[20]For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middle of them.
\[21]Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
\[22]Jesus said to him, I say not to you, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
\[23]Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
\[24]And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
\[25]But for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
\[26]The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.
\[27]Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
\[28]But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that you owe.
\[29]And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and sought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.
\[30]And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
\[31]So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.
\[32]Then his lord, after that he had called him, said to him, O you wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you desired me:
\[33]Should not you also have had compassion on your fellow servant, even as I had pity on you?
\[34]And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.
\[35]So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also to you, if you from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

nd it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;
\[2]And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
\[3]The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
\[4]And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,
\[5]And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall join to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?
\[6]Why they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.
\[7]They say to him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorce, and to put her away?
\[8]He said to them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.
\[9]And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her which is put away does commit adultery.
\[10]His disciples say to him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.
\[11]But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.
\[12]For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
\[13]Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
\[14]But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
\[15]And he laid his hands on them, and departed there.
\[16]And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
\[17]And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.
\[18]He said to him, Which? Jesus said, You shall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,
\[19]Honor your father and your mother: and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
\[20]The young man said to him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
\[21]Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
\[22]But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
\[23]Then said Jesus to his disciples, Truly I say to you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\[24]And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\[25]When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
\[26]But Jesus beheld them, and said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
\[27]Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what shall we have therefore?
\[28]And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\[29]And every one that has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred times, and shall inherit everlasting life.
\[30]But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

or the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.
\[2]And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\[3]And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
\[4]And said to them; Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
\[5]Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
\[6]And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why stand you here all the day idle?
\[7]They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He said to them, Go you also into the vineyard; and whatever is right, that shall you receive.
\[8]So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.
\[9]And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
\[10]But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
\[11]And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,
\[12]Saying, These last have worked but one hour, and you have made them equal to us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
\[13]But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do you no wrong: did not you agree with me for a penny?
\[14]Take that your is, and go your way: I will give to this last, even as to you.
\[15]Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is your eye evil, because I am good?
\[16]So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.
\[17]And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,
\[18]Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
\[19]And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.
\[20]Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
\[21]And he said to her, What will you? She said to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on your right hand, and the other on the left, in your kingdom.
\[22]But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.
\[23]And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
\[24]And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brothers.
\[25]But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority on them.
\[26]But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
\[27]And whoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
\[28]Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
\[29]And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
\[30]And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.
\[31]And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.
\[32]And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will you that I shall do to you?
\[33]They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
\[34]So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

\[2]Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.
\[3]And if any man say ought to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them.
\[4]All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
\[5]Tell you the daughter of Sion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
\[6]And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
\[7]And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.
\[8]And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.
\[9]And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
\[10]And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
\[11]And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
\[12]And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
\[13]And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.
\[14]And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
\[15]And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
\[16]And said to him, Hear you what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?
\[17]And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
\[18]Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungry.
\[19]And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
\[20]And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
\[21]Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.
\[22]And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.
\[23]And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority?
\[24]And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\[25]The baptism of John, from where was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why did you not then believe him?
\[26]But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
\[27]And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
\[28]But what think you? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
\[29]He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
\[30]And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.
\[31]Whether of them two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
\[32]For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and you, when you had seen it, repented not afterward, that you might believe him.
\[33]Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:
\[34]And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, that they might receive the fruits of it.
\[35]And the farmers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
\[36]Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them likewise.
\[37]But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
\[38]But when the farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
\[39]And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.
\[40]When the lord therefore of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?
\[41]They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other farmers, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
\[42]Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
\[43]Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
\[44]And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
\[45]And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.
\[46]But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

nd Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,
\[2]The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
\[3]And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
\[4]Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted calves are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.
\[5]But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
\[6]And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
\[7]But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
\[8]Then said he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
\[9]Go you therefore into the highways, and as many as you shall find, bid to the marriage.
\[10]So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
\[11]And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
\[12]And he said to him, Friend, how came you in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
\[13]Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\[14]For many are called, but few are chosen.
\[15]Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
\[16]And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.
\[17]Tell us therefore, What think you? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
\[18]But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt you me, you hypocrites?
\[19]Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a penny.
\[20]And he said to them, Whose is this image and superscription?
\[21]They say to him, Caesar's. Then said he to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.
\[22]When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left him, and went their way.
\[23]The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
\[24]Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
\[25]Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife to his brother:
\[26]Likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
\[27]And last of all the woman died also.
\[28]Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?  for they all had her.
\[29]Jesus answered and said to them, You do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
\[30]For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
\[31]But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
\[32]I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
\[33]And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
\[34]But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
\[35]Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
\[36]Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
\[37]Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
\[38]This is the first and great commandment.
\[39]And the second is like to it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
\[40]On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
\[41]While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
\[42]Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David.
\[43]He said to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
\[44]The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?
\[45]If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
\[46]And no man was able to answer him a word, neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

hen spoke Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
\[2]Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:
\[3]All therefore whatever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not you after their works: for they say, and do not.
\[4]For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
\[5]But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
\[6]And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
\[7]And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
\[8]But be not you called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all you are brothers.
\[9]And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
\[10]Neither be you called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.
\[11]But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
\[12]And whoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
\[13]But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in.
\[14]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore you shall receive the greater damnation.
\[15]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
\[16]Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
\[17]You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
\[18]And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is guilty.
\[19]You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
\[20]Whoever therefore shall swear by the altar, swears by it, and by all things thereon.
\[21]And whoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it, and by him that dwells therein.
\[22]And he that shall swear by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him that sits thereon.
\[23]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
\[24]You blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
\[25]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
\[26]You blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
\[27]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like to white washed sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.
\[28]Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
\[29]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous,
\[30]And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
\[31]Why you be witnesses to yourselves, that you are the children of them which killed the prophets.
\[32]Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.
\[33]You serpents, you generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell?
\[34]Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:
\[35]That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.
\[36]Truly I say to you, All these things shall come on this generation.
\[37]O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!
\[38]Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\[39]For I say to you, You shall not see me from now on, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.

nd Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.
\[2]And Jesus said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.
\[3]And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?
\[4]And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
\[5]For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
\[6]And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
\[7]For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
\[8]All these are the beginning of sorrows.
\[9]Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
\[10]And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
\[11]And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
\[12]And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
\[13]But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.
\[14]And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.
\[15]When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)
\[16]Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
\[17]Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
\[18]Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.
\[19]And woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
\[20]But pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:
\[21]For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
\[22]And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.
\[23]Then if any man shall say to you, See, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.
\[24]For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
\[25]Behold, I have told you before.
\[26]Why if they shall say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.
\[27]For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\[28]For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
\[29]Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
\[30]And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\[31]And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
\[32]Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:
\[33]So likewise you, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
\[34]Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
\[35]Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
\[36]But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
\[37]But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\[38]For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
\[39]And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
\[40]Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\[41]Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\[42]Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord does come.
\[43]But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
\[44]Therefore be you also ready: for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man comes.
\[45]Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
\[46]Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.
\[47]Truly I say to you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
\[48]But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming;
\[49]And shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
\[50]The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
\[51]And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

hen shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
\[2]And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
\[3]They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
\[4]But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
\[5]While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
\[6]And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go you out to meet him.
\[7]Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
\[8]And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
\[9]But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
\[10]And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
\[11]Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
\[12]But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.
\[13]Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comes.
\[14]For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.
\[15]And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
\[16]Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
\[17]And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
\[18]But he that had received one went and dig in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
\[19]After a long time the lord of those servants comes, and reckons with them.
\[20]And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
\[21]His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.
\[22]He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
\[23]His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.
\[24]Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are an hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not strewed:
\[25]And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth: see, there you have that is yours.
\[26]His lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed:
\[27]You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with usury.
\[28]Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which has ten talents.
\[29]For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.
\[30]And cast you the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\[31]When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:
\[32]And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:
\[33]And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
\[34]Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
\[35]For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:
\[36]Naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.
\[37]Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, and fed you? or thirsty, and gave you drink?
\[38]When saw we you a stranger, and took you in? or naked, and clothed you?
\[39]Or when saw we you sick, or in prison, and came to you?
\[40]And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.
\[41]Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
\[42]For I was an hungered, and you gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink:
\[43]I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.
\[44]Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?
\[45]Then shall he answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.
\[46]And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

nd it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,
\[2]You know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
\[3]Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, to the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
\[4]And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.
\[5]But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.
\[6]Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
\[7]There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.
\[8]But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
\[9]For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
\[10]When Jesus understood it, he said to them, Why trouble you the woman? for she has worked a good work on me.
\[11]For you have the poor always with you; but me you have not always.
\[12]For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.
\[13]Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.
\[14]Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
\[15]And said to them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
\[16]And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
\[17]Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where will you that we prepare for you to eat the passover?
\[18]And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.
\[19]And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
\[20]Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
\[21]And as they did eat, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.
\[22]And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?
\[23]And he answered and said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
\[24]The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
\[25]Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?  He said to him, You have said.
\[26]And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
\[27]And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it;
\[28]For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
\[29]But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
\[30]And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
\[31]Then said Jesus to them, All you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
\[32]But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
\[33]Peter answered and said to him, Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.
\[34]Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.
\[35]Peter said to him, Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.
\[36]Then comes Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit you here, while I go and pray yonder.
\[37]And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
\[38]Then said he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry you here, and watch with me.
\[39]And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.
\[40]And he comes to the disciples, and finds them asleep, and said to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one hour?
\[41]Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
\[42]He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, your will be done.
\[43]And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
\[44]And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
\[45]Then comes he to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\[46]Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that does betray me.
\[47]And while he yet spoke, see, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\[48]Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
\[49]And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
\[50]And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.
\[51]And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
\[52]Then said Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
\[53]Think you that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
\[54]But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
\[55]In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on me.
\[56]But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
\[57]And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
\[58]But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
\[59]Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
\[60]But found none: yes, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
\[61]And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
\[62]And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?
\[63]But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.
\[64]Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
\[65]Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.
\[66]What think you? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
\[67]Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,
\[68]Saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ, Who is he that smote you?
\[69]Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
\[70]But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what you say.
\[71]And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
\[72]And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
\[73]And after a while came to him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech denudes you.
\[74]Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
\[75]And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

hen the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
\[2]And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
\[3]Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
\[4]Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see you to that.
\[5]And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
\[6]And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
\[7]And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
\[8]Why that field was called, The field of blood, to this day.
\[9]Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
\[10]And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
\[11]And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say.
\[12]And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
\[13]Then said Pilate to him, Hear you not how many things they witness against you?
\[14]And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor marveled greatly.
\[15]Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.
\[16]And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
\[17]Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
\[18]For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
\[19]When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have you nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
\[20]But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
\[21]The governor answered and said to them, Whether of the two will you that I release to you? They said, Barabbas.
\[22]Pilate said to them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.
\[23]And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
\[24]When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see you to it.
\[25]Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
\[26]Then released he Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
\[27]Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band of soldiers.
\[28]And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
\[29]And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
\[30]And they spit on him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
\[31]And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
\[32]And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
\[33]And when they were come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
\[34]They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.
\[35]And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and on my clothing did they cast lots.
\[36]And sitting down they watched him there;
\[37]And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[38]Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
\[39]And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
\[40]And saying, You that destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself. If you be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
\[41]Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
\[42]He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
\[43]He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
\[44]The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
\[45]Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land to the ninth hour.
\[46]And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
\[47]Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elias.
\[48]And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
\[49]The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
\[50]Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
\[51]And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
\[52]And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
\[53]And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.
\[54]Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
\[55]And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:
\[56]Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.
\[57]When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:
\[58]He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
\[59]And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\[60]And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed.
\[61]And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulcher.
\[62]Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,
\[63]Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
\[64]Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
\[65]Pilate said to them, You have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as you can.
\[66]So they went, and made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

n the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.
\[2]And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.
\[3]His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
\[4]And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
\[5]And the angel answered and said to the women, Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.
\[6]He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
\[7]And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: see, I have told you.
\[8]And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
\[9]And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
\[10]Then said Jesus to them, Be not afraid: go tell my brothers that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
\[11]Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that were done.
\[12]And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money to the soldiers,
\[13]Saying, Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
\[14]And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
\[15]So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
\[16]Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
\[17]And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
\[18]And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.
\[19]Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
\[20]Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.

he beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
\[2]As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.
\[3]The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\[4]John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
\[5]And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
\[6]And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
\[7]And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
\[8]I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
\[9]And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
\[10]And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending on him:
\[11]And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\[12]And immediately the spirit drives him into the wilderness.
\[13]And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.
\[14]Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
\[15]And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel.
\[16]Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
\[17]And Jesus said to them, Come you after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
\[18]And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
\[19]And when he had gone a little farther there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
\[20]And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
\[21]And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
\[22]And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
\[23]And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
\[24]Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.
\[25]And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.
\[26]And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
\[27]And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commands he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
\[28]And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
\[29]And immediately, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
\[30]But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and immediately they tell him of her.
\[31]And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.
\[32]And at even, when the sun did set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
\[33]And all the city was gathered together at the door.
\[34]And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
\[35]And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
\[36]And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
\[37]And when they had found him, they said to him, All men seek for you.
\[38]And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.
\[39]And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
\[40]And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean.
\[41]And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I will; be you clean.
\[42]And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
\[43]And he straightly charged him, and immediately sent him away;
\[44]And said to him, See you say nothing to any man: but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
\[45]But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.

nd again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
\[2]And straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word to them.
\[3]And they come to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
\[4]And when they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
\[5]When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick of the palsy, Son, your sins be forgiven you.
\[6]But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
\[7]Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
\[8]And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why reason you these things in your hearts?
\[9]Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?
\[10]But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick of the palsy,)
\[11]I say to you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go your way into your house.
\[12]And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
\[13]And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.
\[14]And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
\[15]And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
\[16]And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?
\[17]When Jesus heard it, he said to them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\[18]And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?
\[19]And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
\[20]But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
\[21]No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
\[22]And no man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.
\[23]And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
\[24]And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
\[25]And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with him?
\[26]How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?
\[27]And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
\[28]Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

nd he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
\[2]And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
\[3]And he said to the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
\[4]And he said to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
\[5]And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\[6]And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
\[7]But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
\[8]And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him.
\[9]And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
\[10]For he had healed many; so that they pressed on him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
\[11]And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.
\[12]And he straightly charged them that they should not make him known.
\[13]And he goes up into a mountain, and calls to him whom he would: and they came to him.
\[14]And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
\[15]And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
\[16]And Simon he surnamed Peter;
\[17]And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
\[18]And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
\[19]And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
\[20]And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
\[21]And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
\[22]And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casts he out devils.
\[23]And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
\[24]And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
\[25]And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
\[26]And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.
\[27]No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
\[28]Truly I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which soever they shall blaspheme:
\[29]But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.
\[30]Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
\[31]There came then his brothers and his mother, and, standing without, sent to him, calling him.
\[32]And the multitude sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers without seek for you.
\[33]And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brothers?
\[34]And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!
\[35]For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

nd he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered to him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
\[2]And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine,
\[3]Listen; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
\[4]And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
\[5]And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
\[6]But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
\[7]And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
\[8]And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
\[9]And he said to them, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
\[10]And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
\[11]And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
\[12]That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
\[13]And he said to them, Know you not this parable? and how then will you know all parables?
\[14]The sower sows the word.
\[15]And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan comes immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
\[16]And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
\[17]And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution rises for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.
\[18]And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
\[19]And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
\[20]And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirty times, some sixty, and some an hundred.
\[21]And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
\[22]For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
\[23]If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
\[24]And he said to them, Take heed what you hear: with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given.
\[25]For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.
\[26]And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
\[27]And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.
\[28]For the earth brings forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
\[29]But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
\[30]And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
\[31]It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
\[32]But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
\[33]And with many such parables spoke he the word to them, as they were able to hear it.
\[34]But without a parable spoke he not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
\[35]And the same day, when the even was come, he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side.
\[36]And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
\[37]And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
\[38]And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, care you not that we perish?
\[39]And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
\[40]And he said to them, Why are you so fearful? how is it that you have no faith?
\[41]And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

nd they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
\[2]And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
\[3]Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
\[4]Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
\[5]And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
\[6]But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
\[7]And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God? I adjure you by God, that you torment me not.
\[8]For he said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.
\[9]And he asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
\[10]And he sought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
\[11]Now there was there near to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
\[12]And all the devils sought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
\[13]And immediately Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
\[14]And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
\[15]And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
\[16]And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.
\[17]And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
\[18]And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
\[19]However, Jesus suffered him not, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for you, and has had compassion on you.
\[20]And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.
\[21]And when Jesus was passed over again by ship to the other side, much people gathered to him: and he was near to the sea.
\[22]And, behold, there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
\[23]And sought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: I pray you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
\[24]And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.
\[25]And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
\[26]And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
\[27]When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.
\[28]For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
\[29]And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
\[30]And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?
\[31]And his disciples said to him, You see the multitude thronging you, and say you, Who touched me?
\[32]And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
\[33]But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
\[34]And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.
\[35]While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?
\[36]As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he said to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
\[37]And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
\[38]And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
\[39]And when he was come in, he said to them, Why make you this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleeps.
\[40]And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he takes the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and enters in where the damsel was lying.
\[41]And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say to you, arise.
\[42]And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
\[43]And he charged them straightly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.

nd he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
\[2]And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are worked by his hands?
\[3]Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
\[4]But Jesus, said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
\[5]And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.
\[6]And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.
\[7]And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
\[8]And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no money, no bread, no money in their purse:
\[9]But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
\[10]And he said to them, In what place soever you enter into an house, there abide till you depart from that place.
\[11]And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you depart there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.  Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
\[12]And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
\[13]And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
\[14]And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
\[15]Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
\[16]But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
\[17]For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold on John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
\[18]For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.
\[19]Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
\[20]For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
\[21]And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;
\[22]And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever you will, and I will give it you.
\[23]And he swore to her, Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give it you, to the half of my kingdom.
\[24]And she went forth, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
\[25]And she came in straightway with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that you give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
\[26]And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
\[27]And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
\[28]And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
\[29]And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
\[30]And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.
\[31]And he said to them, Come you yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
\[32]And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
\[33]And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and preceded them, and came together to him.
\[34]And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
\[35]And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:
\[36]Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.
\[37]He answered and said to them, Give you them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?
\[38]He said to them, How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
\[39]And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass.
\[40]And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
\[41]And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
\[42]And they did all eat, and were filled.
\[43]And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.
\[44]And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
\[45]And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.
\[46]And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.
\[47]And when even was come, the ship was in the middle of the sea, and he alone on the land.
\[48]And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.
\[49]But when they saw him walking on the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:
\[50]For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and said to them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
\[51]And he went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
\[52]For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
\[53]And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
\[54]And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,
\[55]And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
\[56]And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and sought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

hen came together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
\[2]And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault.
\[3]For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
\[4]And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not.  And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables.
\[5]Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not your disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
\[6]He answered and said to them, Well has Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
\[7]However, in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
\[8]For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you do.
\[9]And he said to them, Full well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.
\[10]For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death:
\[11]But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me; he shall be free.
\[12]And you suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
\[13]Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which you have delivered: and many such like things do you.
\[14]And when he had called all the people to him, he said to them, Listen to me every one of you, and understand:
\[15]There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
\[16]If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
\[17]And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
\[18]And he said to them, Are you so without understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from without enters into the man, it cannot defile him;
\[19]Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats?
\[20]And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.
\[21]For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
\[22]Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
\[23]All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
\[24]And from there he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.
\[25]For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
\[26]The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she sought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
\[27]But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs.
\[28]And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
\[29]And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the devil is gone out of your daughter.
\[30]And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid on the bed.
\[31]And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the coasts of Decapolis.
\[32]And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand on him.
\[33]And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
\[34]And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
\[35]And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.
\[36]And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;
\[37]And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

n those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,
\[2]I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
\[3]And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
\[4]And his disciples answered him, From where can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
\[5]And he asked them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven.
\[6]And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.
\[7]And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.
\[8]So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.
\[9]And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
\[10]And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
\[11]And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
\[12]And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek after a sign? truly I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.
\[13]And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
\[14]Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
\[15]And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
\[16]And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
\[17]And when Jesus knew it, he said to them, Why reason you, because you have no bread? perceive you not yet, neither understand? have you your heart yet hardened?
\[18]Having eyes, see you not? and having ears, hear you not? and do you not remember?
\[19]When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him, Twelve.
\[20]And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? And they said, Seven.
\[21]And he said to them, How is it that you do not understand?
\[22]And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and sought him to touch him.
\[23]And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands on him, he asked him if he saw ought.
\[24]And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
\[25]After that he put his hands again on his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
\[26]And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
\[27]And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Whom do men say that I am?
\[28]And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
\[29]And he said to them, But whom say you that I am? And Peter answers and said to him, You are the Christ.
\[30]And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
\[31]And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
\[32]And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
\[33]But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get you behind me, Satan: for you mind not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.
\[34]And when he had called the people to him with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
\[35]For whoever will save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
\[36]For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
\[37]Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
\[38]Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

\[2]And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
\[3]And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
\[4]And there appeared to them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
\[5]And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
\[6]For he knew not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
\[7]And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
\[8]And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
\[9]And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
\[10]And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
\[11]And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
\[12]And he answered and told them, Elias truly comes first, and restores all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nothing.
\[13]But I say to you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they listed, as it is written of him.
\[14]And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
\[15]And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
\[16]And he asked the scribes, What question you with them?
\[17]And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to you my son, which has a dumb spirit;
\[18]And wherever he takes him, he tears him: and he foams, and gnashes with his teeth, and pines away: and I spoke to your disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
\[19]He answers him, and said, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him to me.
\[20]And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
\[21]And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came to him?  And he said, Of a child.
\[22]And often it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
\[23]Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him that believes.
\[24]And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help you my unbelief.
\[25]When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
\[26]And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; so that many said, He is dead.
\[27]But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
\[28]And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
\[29]And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
\[30]And they departed there, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
\[31]For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
\[32]But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
\[33]And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way?
\[34]But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.
\[35]And he sat down, and called the twelve, and said to them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.
\[36]And he took a child, and set him in the middle of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them,
\[37]Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me: and whoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me.
\[38]And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbade him, because he follows not us.
\[39]But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
\[40]For he that is not against us is on our part.
\[41]For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
\[42]And whoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
\[43]And if your hand offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
\[44]Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
\[45]And if your foot offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
\[46]Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
\[47]And if your eye offend you, pluck it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
\[48]Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
\[49]For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
\[50]Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltiness, with which will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

\[3]And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?
\[4]And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.
\[5]And Jesus answered and said to them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
\[6]But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
\[7]For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and join to his wife;
\[8]And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.

\[15]Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
\[16]And he took them up in his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them.
\[17]And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
\[18]And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.
\[19]You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor your father and mother.
\[20]And he answered and said to him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
\[21]Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
\[22]And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
\[23]And Jesus looked round about, and said to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
\[24]And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answers again, and said to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
\[25]It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\[26]And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
\[27]And Jesus looking on them said, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
\[28]Then Peter began to say to him, See, we have left all, and have followed you.
\[29]And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,
\[30]But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
\[31]But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
\[32]And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.  And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,
\[33]Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
\[34]And they shall mock him, and shall whip him, and shall spit on him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
\[35]And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire.
\[36]And he said to them, What would you that I should do for you?
\[37]They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left hand, in your glory.
\[38]But Jesus said to them, You know not what you ask: can you drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
\[39]And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized:
\[40]But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not my to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
\[41]And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
\[42]But Jesus called them to him, and said to them, You know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority on them.
\[43]But so shall it not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
\[44]And whoever of you will be the most chief, shall be servant of all.
\[45]For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
\[46]And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
\[47]And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.
\[48]And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, You son of David, have mercy on me.
\[49]And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calls you.
\[50]And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
\[51]And Jesus answered and said to him, What will you that I should do to you? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
\[52]And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

nd when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,
\[2]And said to them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as you be entered into it, you shall find a colt tied, where on never man sat; loose him, and bring him.
\[3]And if any man say to you, Why do you this? say you that the Lord has need of him; and straightway he will send him here.
\[4]And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
\[5]And certain of them that stood there said to them, What do you, loosing the colt?
\[6]And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
\[7]And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat on him.
\[8]And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strewed them in the way.
\[9]And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord:
\[10]Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that comes in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
\[11]And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about on all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
\[12]And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
\[13]And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.
\[14]And Jesus answered and said to it, No man eat fruit of you hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.
\[15]And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
\[16]And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
\[17]And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but you have made it a den of thieves.
\[18]And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
\[19]And when even was come, he went out of the city.
\[20]And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
\[21]And Peter calling to remembrance said to him, Master, behold, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away.
\[22]And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God.
\[23]For truly I say to you, That whoever shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he said.
\[24]Therefore I say to you, What things soever you desire, when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them.
\[25]And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
\[26]But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
\[27]And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
\[28]And say to him, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority to do these things?
\[29]And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\[30]The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
\[31]And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?
\[32]But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
\[33]And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

nd he began to speak to them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and dig a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country.
\[2]And at the season he sent to the farmers a servant, that he might receive from the farmers of the fruit of the vineyard.
\[3]And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
\[4]And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.
\[5]And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
\[6]Having yet therefore one son, his well beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son.
\[7]But those farmers said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.
\[8]And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
\[9]What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.
\[10]And have you not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
\[11]This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
\[12]And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
\[13]And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.
\[14]And when they were come, they say to him, Master, we know that you are true, and care for no man: for you regard not the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
\[15]Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt you me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.
\[16]And they brought it. And he said to them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.
\[17]And Jesus answering said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marveled at him.
\[18]Then come to him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
\[19]Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
\[20]Now there were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
\[21]And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
\[22]And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
\[23]In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
\[24]And Jesus answering said to them, Do you not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
\[25]For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
\[26]And as touching the dead, that they rise: have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
\[27]He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: you therefore do greatly err.
\[28]And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
\[29]And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
\[30]And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength: this is the first commandment.
\[31]And the second is like, namely this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
\[32]And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
\[33]And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
\[34]And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question.
\[35]And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?
\[36]For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.
\[37]David therefore himself calls him Lord; and from where is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
\[38]And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,
\[39]And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
\[40]Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
\[41]And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
\[42]And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
\[43]And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Truly I say to you, That this poor widow has cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
\[44]For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

nd as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
\[2]And Jesus answering said to him, See you these great buildings?  there shall not be left one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.
\[3]And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
\[4]Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
\[5]And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:
\[6]For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
\[7]And when you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be you not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.
\[8]For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.
\[9]But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues you shall be beaten: and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
\[10]And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
\[11]But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what you shall speak, neither do you premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak you: for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
\[12]Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
\[13]And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.
\[14]But when you shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that reads understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
\[15]And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:
\[16]And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
\[17]But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
\[18]And pray you that your flight be not in the winter.
\[19]For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall be.
\[20]And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.
\[21]And then if any man shall say to you, See, here is Christ; or, see, he is there; believe him not:
\[22]For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.
\[23]But take you heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
\[24]But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
\[25]And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
\[26]And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
\[27]And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
\[28]Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:
\[29]So you in like manner, when you shall see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the doors.
\[30]Truly I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
\[31]Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
\[32]But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
\[33]Take you heed, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is.
\[34]For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.
\[35]Watch you therefore: for you know not when the master of the house comes, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:
\[36]Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
\[37]And what I say to you I say to all, Watch.

fter two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.
\[2]But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.
\[3]And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.
\[4]And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
\[5]For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
\[6]And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble you her? she has worked a good work on me.
\[7]For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you will you may do them good: but me you have not always.
\[8]She has done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
\[9]Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
\[10]And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.
\[11]And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
\[12]And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, Where will you that we go and prepare that you may eat the passover?
\[13]And he sends forth two of his disciples, and said to them, Go you into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
\[14]And wherever he shall go in, say you to the manager of the house, The Master said, Where is the guest room, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
\[15]And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
\[16]And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.
\[17]And in the evening he comes with the twelve.
\[18]And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, One of you which eats with me shall betray me.
\[19]And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
\[20]And he answered and said to them, It is one of the twelve, that dips with me in the dish.
\[21]The Son of man indeed goes, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
\[22]And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
\[23]And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.
\[24]And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
\[25]Truly I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
\[26]And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
\[27]And Jesus said to them, All you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
\[28]But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
\[29]But Peter said to him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
\[30]And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, you shall deny me thrice.
\[31]But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with you, I will not deny you in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
\[32]And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he said to his disciples, Sit you here, while I shall pray.
\[33]And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
\[34]And said to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful to death: tarry you here, and watch.
\[35]And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
\[36]And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will.
\[37]And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, sleep you? could not you watch one hour?
\[38]Watch you and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.
\[39]And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words.
\[40]And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither knew they what to answer him.
\[41]And he comes the third time, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\[42]Rise up, let us go; see, he that betrays me is at hand.
\[43]And immediately, while he yet spoke, comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
\[44]And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
\[45]And as soon as he was come, he goes straightway to him, and said, Master, master; and kissed him.
\[46]And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
\[47]And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
\[48]And Jesus answered and said to them, Are you come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?
\[49]I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
\[50]And they all forsook him, and fled.
\[51]And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:
\[52]And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
\[53]And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
\[54]And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
\[55]And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
\[56]For many bore false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
\[57]And there arose certain, and bore false witness against him, saying,
\[58]We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
\[59]But neither so did their witness agree together.
\[60]And the high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, saying, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?
\[61]But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
\[62]And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
\[63]Then the high priest rent his clothes, and said, What need we any further witnesses?
\[64]You have heard the blasphemy: what think you? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
\[65]And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
\[66]And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest:
\[67]And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked on him, and said, And you also were with Jesus of Nazareth.
\[68]But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what you say. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
\[69]And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.
\[70]And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely you are one of them: for you are a Galilaean, and your speech agrees thereto.
\[71]But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom you speak.
\[72]And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him, Before the cock crow twice, you shall deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

nd straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
\[2]And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering said to them, You say it.
\[3]And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
\[4]And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answer you nothing? behold how many things they witness against you.
\[5]But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marveled.
\[6]Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
\[7]And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
\[8]And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done to them.
\[9]But Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?
\[10]For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
\[11]But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
\[12]And Pilate answered and said again to them, What will you then that I shall do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?
\[13]And they cried out again, Crucify him.
\[14]Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
\[15]And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
\[16]And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
\[17]And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
\[18]And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
\[19]And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit on him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
\[20]And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
\[21]And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
\[22]And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
\[23]And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
\[24]And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots on them, what every man should take.
\[25]And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
\[26]And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[27]And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
\[28]And the scripture was fulfilled, which said, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
\[29]And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
\[30]Save yourself, and come down from the cross.
\[31]Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
\[32]Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
\[33]And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
\[34]And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
\[35]And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elias.
\[36]And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
\[37]And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
\[38]And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
\[39]And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
\[40]There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
\[41](Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;) and many other women which came up with him to Jerusalem.
\[42]And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
\[43]Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counselor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
\[44]And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
\[45]And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
\[46]And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.
\[47]And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.

nd when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
\[2]And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came to the sepulcher at the rising of the sun.
\[3]And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?
\[4]And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
\[5]And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
\[6]And he said to them, Be not affrighted: You seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
\[7]But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall you see him, as he said to you.
\[8]And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.
\[9]Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
\[10]And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
\[11]And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
\[12]After that he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
\[13]And they went and told it to the residue: neither believed they them.
\[14]Afterward he appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
\[15]And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
\[16]He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.
\[17]And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
\[18]They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
\[19]So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
\[20]And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

or as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
\[2]Even as they delivered them to us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
\[3]It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,
\[4]That you might know the certainty of those things, wherein you have been instructed.
\[5]THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
\[6]And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
\[7]And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.
\[8]And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,
\[9]According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
\[10]And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
\[11]And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
\[12]And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell on him.
\[13]But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elisabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
\[14]And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
\[15]For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
\[16]And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
\[17]And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
\[18]And Zacharias said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
\[19]And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to you, and to show you these glad tidings.
\[20]And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
\[21]And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple.
\[22]And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.
\[23]And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
\[24]And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
\[25]Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.
\[26]And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\[27]To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
\[28]And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.
\[29]And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
\[30]And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favor with God.
\[31]And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.
\[32]He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:
\[33]And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
\[34]Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
\[35]And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.
\[36]And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
\[37]For with God nothing shall be impossible.
\[38]And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
\[39]And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;
\[40]And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
\[41]And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:
\[42]And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
\[43]And what is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\[44]For, see, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
\[45]And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
\[46]And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,
\[47]And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
\[48]For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.
\[49]For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name.
\[50]And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
\[51]He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
\[52]He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.
\[53]He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.
\[54]He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
\[55]As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
\[56]And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
\[57]Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
\[58]And her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy on her; and they rejoiced with her.
\[59]And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
\[60]And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
\[61]And they said to her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.
\[62]And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
\[63]And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all.
\[64]And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.
\[65]And fear came on all that dwelled round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
\[66]And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
\[67]And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
\[68]Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,
\[69]And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
\[70]As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:
\[71]That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
\[72]To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;
\[73]The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,
\[74]That he would grant to us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
\[75]In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
\[76]And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
\[77]To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,
\[78]Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,
\[79]To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
\[80]And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.

nd it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
\[2](And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
\[3]And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
\[4]And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
\[5]To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
\[6]And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
\[7]And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
\[8]And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
\[9]And, see, the angel of the Lord came on them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
\[10]And the angel said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
\[11]For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.
\[12]And this shall be a sign to you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
\[13]And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
\[14]Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
\[15]And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.
\[16]And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
\[17]And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.
\[18]And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
\[19]But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
\[20]And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them.
\[21]And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\[22]And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;
\[23](As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
\[24]And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
\[25]And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.
\[26]And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
\[27]And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
\[28]Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
\[29]Lord, now let you your servant depart in peace, according to your word:
\[30]For my eyes have seen your salvation,
\[31]Which you have prepared before the face of all people;
\[32]A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.
\[33]And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him.
\[34]And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
\[35](Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
\[36]And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;
\[37]And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
\[38]And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
\[39]And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
\[40]And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was on him.
\[41]Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
\[42]And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.
\[43]And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.
\[44]But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
\[45]And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
\[46]And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
\[47]And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
\[48]And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? behold, your father and I have sought you sorrowing.
\[49]And he said to them, How is it that you sought me? knew you not that I must be about my Father's business?
\[50]And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.
\[51]And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
\[52]And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.

ow in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
\[2]Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
\[3]And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
\[4]As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\[5]Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;
\[6]And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
\[7]Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\[8]Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
\[9]And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
\[10]And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
\[11]He answers and said to them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise.
\[12]Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said to him, Master, what shall we do?
\[13]And he said to them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
\[14]And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.
\[15]And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;
\[16]John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:
\[17]Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
\[18]And many other things in his exhortation preached he to the people.
\[19]But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
\[20]Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
\[21]Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
\[22]And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove on him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.
\[23]And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,
\[24]Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph,

nd Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
\[2]Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungry.
\[3]And the devil said to him, If you be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
\[4]And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
\[5]And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, showed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
\[6]And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
\[7]If you therefore will worship me, all shall be yours.
\[8]And Jesus answered and said to him, Get you behind me, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.
\[9]And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down from hence:
\[10]For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you:
\[11]And in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.
\[12]And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.
\[13]And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
\[14]And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
\[15]And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
\[16]And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
\[17]And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
\[18]The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
\[19]To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
\[20]And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
\[21]And he began to say to them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
\[22]And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
\[23]And he said to them, You will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.
\[24]And he said, Truly I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
\[25]But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;
\[26]But to none of them was Elias sent, save to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.
\[27]And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.
\[28]And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
\[29]And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill where on their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
\[30]But he passing through the middle of them went his way,
\[31]And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
\[32]And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
\[33]And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,
\[34]Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are; the Holy One of God.
\[35]And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.  And when the devil had thrown him in the middle, he came out of him, and hurt him not.
\[36]And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.
\[37]And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
\[38]And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.  And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they sought him for her.
\[39]And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered to them.
\[40]Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
\[41]And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, You are Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
\[42]And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
\[43]And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
\[44]And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

nd it came to pass, that, as the people pressed on him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
\[2]And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
\[3]And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
\[4]Now when he had left speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
\[5]And Simon answering said to him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at your word I will let down the net.
\[6]And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.
\[7]And they beckoned to their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
\[8]When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
\[9]For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:
\[10]And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now on you shall catch men.
\[11]And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.
\[12]And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and sought him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.
\[13]And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be you clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
\[14]And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
\[15]But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
\[16]And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
\[17]And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
\[18]And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
\[19]And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went on the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the middle before Jesus.
\[20]And when he saw their faith, he said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.
\[21]And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
\[22]But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said to them, What reason you in your hearts?
\[23]Whether is easier, to say, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?
\[24]But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick of the palsy,) I say to you, Arise, and take up your couch, and go into your house.
\[25]And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that where on he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
\[26]And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
\[27]And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me.
\[28]And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
\[29]And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.
\[30]But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
\[31]And Jesus answering said to them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.
\[32]I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\[33]And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but your eat and drink?
\[34]And he said to them, Can you make the children of the bridal chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
\[35]But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
\[36]And he spoke also a parable to them; No man puts a piece of a new garment on an old; if otherwise, then both the new makes a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agrees not with the old.
\[37]And no man puts new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.
\[38]But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
\[39]No man also having drunk old wine straightway desires new: for he said, The old is better.

nd it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
\[2]And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
\[3]And Jesus answering them said, Have you not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungered, and they which were with him;
\[4]How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the show bread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
\[5]And he said to them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
\[6]And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.
\[7]And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.
\[8]But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the middle. And he arose and stood forth.
\[9]Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?
\[10]And looking round about on them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\[11]And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
\[12]And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
\[13]And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;
\[14]Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
\[15]Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,
\[16]And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.
\[17]And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
\[18]And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
\[19]And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.
\[20]And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
\[21]Blessed are you that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are you that weep now: for you shall laugh.
\[22]Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.
\[23]Rejoice you in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers to the prophets.
\[24]But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.
\[25]Woe to you that are full! for you shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for you shall mourn and weep.
\[26]Woe to you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.
\[27]But I say to you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,
\[28]Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which spitefully use you.
\[29]And to him that smites you on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that takes away your cloak forbid not to take your coat also.
\[30]Give to every man that asks of you; and of him that takes away your goods ask them not again.
\[31]And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them likewise.
\[32]For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them.
\[33]And if you do good to them which do good to you, what thank have you?  for sinners also do even the same.
\[34]And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thank have you? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.
\[35]But love you your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.
\[36]Be you therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
\[37]Judge not, and you shall not be judged: condemn not, and you shall not be condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgiven:
\[38]Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you mete with it shall be measured to you again.
\[39]And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
\[40]The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
\[41]And why behold you the mote that is in your brother's eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your own eye?
\[42]Either how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in your eye, when you yourself behold not the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then shall you see clearly to pull out the mote that is in your brother's eye.
\[43]For a good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
\[44]For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
\[45]A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
\[46]And why call you me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
\[47]Whoever comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:
\[48]He is like a man which built an house, and dig deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently on that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded on a rock.
\[49]But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house on the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

ow when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
\[2]And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die.
\[3]And when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
\[4]And when they came to Jesus, they sought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
\[5]For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.
\[6]Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not yourself: for I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof:
\[7]Why neither thought I myself worthy to come to you: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
\[8]For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
\[9]When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned him about, and said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\[10]And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.
\[11]And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
\[12]Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
\[13]And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Weep not.
\[14]And he came and touched the bier: and they that bore him stood still.  And he said, Young man, I say to you, Arise.
\[15]And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
\[16]And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God has visited his people.
\[17]And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.
\[18]And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.
\[19]And John calling to him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?
\[20]When the men were come to him, they said, John Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he that should come? or look we for another?
\[21]And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and to many that were blind he gave sight.
\[22]Then Jesus answering said to them, Go your way, and tell John what things you have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.
\[23]And blessed is he, whoever shall not be offended in me.
\[24]And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went you out into the wilderness for to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?
\[25]But what went you out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  Behold, they which are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.
\[26]But what went you out for to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
\[27]This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.
\[28]For I say to you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
\[29]And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
\[30]But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
\[31]And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
\[32]They are like to children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you have not wept.
\[33]For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say, He has a devil.
\[34]The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and you say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners!
\[35]But wisdom is justified of all her children.
\[36]And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.
\[37]And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
\[38]And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
\[39]Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him: for she is a sinner.
\[40]And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to you. And he said, Master, say on.
\[41]There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
\[42]And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
\[43]Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.  And he said to him, You have rightly judged.
\[44]And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, See you this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet: but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
\[45]You gave me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet.
\[46]My head with oil you did not anoint: but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.
\[47]Why I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.
\[48]And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.
\[49]And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?
\[50]And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.

nd it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,
\[2]And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
\[3]And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered to him of their substance.
\[4]And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:
\[5]A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
\[6]And some fell on a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
\[7]And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
\[8]And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit an hundred times. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
\[9]And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
\[10]And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
\[11]Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
\[12]Those by the way side are they that hear; then comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
\[13]They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
\[14]And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
\[15]But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
\[16]No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but sets it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.
\[17]For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.
\[18]Take heed therefore how you hear: for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.
\[19]Then came to him his mother and his brothers, and could not come at him for the press.
\[20]And it was told him by certain which said, Your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to see you.
\[21]And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brothers are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
\[22]Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
\[23]But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.
\[24]And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\[25]And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him.
\[26]And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
\[27]And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither stayed in any house, but in the tombs.
\[28]When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God most high? I beseech you, torment me not.
\[29](For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)
\[30]And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.
\[31]And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
\[32]And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they sought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.
\[33]Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.
\[34]When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.
\[35]Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
\[36]They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.
\[37]Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about sought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.
\[38]Now the man out of whom the devils were departed sought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\[39]Return to your own house, and show how great things God has done to you. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done to him.
\[40]And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.
\[41]And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and sought him that he would come into his house:
\[42]For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
\[43]And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living on physicians, neither could be healed of any,
\[44]Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
\[45]And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng you and press you, and say you, Who touched me?
\[46]And Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
\[47]And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
\[48]And he said to her, Daughter, be of good comfort: your faith has made you whole; go in peace.
\[49]While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Your daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
\[50]But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.
\[51]And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
\[52]And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.
\[53]And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
\[54]And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
\[55]And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
\[56]And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

hen he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
\[2]And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
\[3]And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor money, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.
\[4]And whatever house you enter into, there abide, and there depart.
\[5]And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
\[6]And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.
\[7]Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;
\[8]And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
\[9]And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

\[12]And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
\[13]But he said to them, Give you them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.
\[14]For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
\[15]And they did so, and made them all sit down.
\[16]Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
\[17]And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
\[18]And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
\[19]They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
\[20]He said to them, But whom say you that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
\[21]And he straightly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;
\[22]Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.
\[23]And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
\[24]For whoever will save his life shall lose it: but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
\[25]For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?
\[26]For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.
\[27]But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
\[28]And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
\[29]And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
\[30]And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:
\[31]Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
\[32]But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
\[33]And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
\[34]While he thus spoke, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
\[35]And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
\[36]And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.
\[37]And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.
\[38]And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech you, look on my son: for he is my only child.
\[39]And, see, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams again, and bruising him hardly departs from him.
\[40]And I sought your disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
\[41]And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring your son here.
\[42]And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
\[43]And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
\[44]Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
\[45]But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
\[46]Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
\[47]And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,
\[48]And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever shall receive me receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
\[49]And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name; and we forbade him, because he follows not with us.
\[50]And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.
\[51]And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
\[52]And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
\[53]And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
\[54]And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
\[55]But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You know not what manner of spirit you are of.
\[56]For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.
\[57]And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go.
\[58]And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
\[59]And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\[60]Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go you and preach the kingdom of God.
\[61]And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.
\[62]And Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

fter these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.
\[2]Therefore said he to them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few: pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.
\[3]Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
\[4]Carry neither purse, nor money, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.
\[5]And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
\[6]And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest on it: if not, it shall turn to you again.
\[7]And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
\[8]And into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
\[9]And heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come near to you.
\[10]But into whatever city you enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,
\[11]Even the very dust of your city, which sticks on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be you sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come near to you.
\[12]But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
\[13]Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\[14]But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.
\[15]And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.
\[16]He that hears you hears me; and he that despises you despises me; and he that despises me despises him that sent me.
\[17]And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.
\[18]And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
\[19]Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
\[20]Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
\[21]In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in your sight.
\[22]All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.
\[23]And he turned him to his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see:
\[24]For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them.
\[25]And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\[26]He said to him, What is written in the law? how read you?
\[27]And he answering said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.
\[28]And he said to him, You have answered right: this do, and you shall live.
\[29]But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
\[30]And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
\[31]And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\[32]And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
\[33]But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,
\[34]And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
\[35]And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever you spend more, when I come again, I will repay you.
\[36]Which now of these three, think you, was neighbor to him that fell among the thieves?
\[37]And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do you likewise.
\[38]Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
\[39]And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.
\[40]But Martha was encumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?  bid her therefore that she help me.
\[41]And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are careful and troubled about many things:
\[42]But one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

nd it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
\[2]And he said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
\[3]Give us day by day our daily bread.
\[4]And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
\[5]And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
\[6]For a friend of my in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
\[7]And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you.
\[8]I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.
\[9]And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
\[10]For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.
\[11]If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
\[12]Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
\[13]If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
\[14]And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.
\[15]But some of them said, He casts out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
\[16]And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
\[17]But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falls.
\[18]If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because you say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
\[19]And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
\[20]But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.
\[21]When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace:
\[22]But when a stronger than he shall come on him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils.
\[23]He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathers not with me scatters.
\[24]When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he said, I will return to my house from where I came out.
\[25]And when he comes, he finds it swept and garnished.
\[26]Then goes he, and takes to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
\[27]And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which you have sucked.
\[28]But he said, Yes rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
\[29]And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
\[30]For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
\[31]The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
\[32]The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
\[33]No man, when he has lighted a candle, puts it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.
\[34]The light of the body is the eye: therefore when your eye is single, your whole body also is full of light; but when your eye is evil, your body also is full of darkness.
\[35]Take heed therefore that the light which is in you be not darkness.
\[36]If your whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle does give you light.
\[37]And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee sought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
\[38]And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner.
\[39]And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
\[40]You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
\[41]But rather give alms of such things as you have; and, behold, all things are clean to you.
\[42]But woe to you, Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
\[43]Woe to you, Pharisees! for you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
\[44]Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.
\[45]Then answered one of the lawyers, and said to him, Master, thus saying you reproach us also.
\[46]And he said, Woe to you also, you lawyers! for you lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and you yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
\[47]Woe to you! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\[48]Truly you bear witness that you allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchers.
\[49]Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:
\[50]That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
\[51]From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: truly I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.
\[52]Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you hindered.
\[53]And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:
\[54]Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

n the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they stepped one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
\[2]For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.
\[3]Therefore whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which you have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the housetops.
\[4]And I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
\[5]But I will forewarn you whom you shall fear: Fear him, which after he has killed has power to cast into hell; yes, I say to you, Fear him.
\[6]Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
\[7]But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.
\[8]Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
\[9]But he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
\[10]And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemes against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.
\[11]And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:
\[12]For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you ought to say.
\[13]And one of the company said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
\[14]And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
\[15]And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.
\[16]And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
\[17]And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
\[18]And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
\[19]And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
\[20]But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?
\[21]So is he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
\[22]And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat; neither for the body, what you shall put on.
\[23]The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.
\[24]Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are you better than the fowls?
\[25]And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
\[26]If you then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take you thought for the rest?
\[27]Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\[28]If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?
\[29]And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, neither be you of doubtful mind.
\[30]For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knows that you have need of these things.
\[31]But rather seek you the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you.
\[32]Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
\[33]Sell that you have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupts.
\[34]For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\[35]Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;
\[36]And you yourselves like to men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.
\[37]Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.
\[38]And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.
\[39]And this know, that if the manager of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.
\[40]Be you therefore ready also: for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.
\[41]Then Peter said to him, Lord, speak you this parable to us, or even to all?
\[42]And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?
\[43]Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.
\[44]Of a truth I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.
\[45]But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delays his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
\[46]The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
\[47]And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
\[48]But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
\[49]I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?
\[50]But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
\[51]Suppose you that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, No; but rather division:
\[52]For from now on there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
\[53]The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
\[54]And he said also to the people, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway you say, There comes a shower; and so it is.
\[55]And when you see the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it comes to pass.
\[56]You hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that you do not discern this time?
\[57]Yes, and why even of yourselves judge you not what is right?
\[58]When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, as you are in the way, give diligence that you may be delivered from him; lest he hale you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into prison.
\[59]I tell you, you shall not depart there, till you have paid the very last mite.

here were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
\[2]And Jesus answering said to them, Suppose you that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?
\[3]I tell you, No: but, except you repent, you shall all likewise perish.
\[4]Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?
\[5]I tell you, No: but, except you repent, you shall all likewise perish.
\[6]He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
\[7]Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why encumbers it the ground?
\[8]And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:
\[9]And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.
\[10]And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
\[11]And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.
\[12]And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.
\[13]And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
\[14]And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said to the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
\[15]The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?
\[16]And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, see, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?
\[17]And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
\[18]Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?
\[19]It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.
\[20]And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
\[21]It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
\[22]And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
\[23]Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said to them,
\[24]Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
\[25]When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not from where you are:
\[26]Then shall you begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets.
\[27]But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not from where you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.
\[28]There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.
\[29]And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
\[30]And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
\[31]The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill you.
\[32]And he said to them, Go you, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.
\[33]Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
\[34]O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!
\[35]Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and truly I say to you, You shall not see me, until the time come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.

nd it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.
\[2]And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.
\[3]And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
\[4]And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;
\[5]And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
\[6]And they could not answer him again to these things.
\[7]And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying to them.
\[8]When you are bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honorable man than you be bidden of him;
\[9]And he that bade you and him come and say to you, Give this man place; and you begin with shame to take the lowest room.
\[10]But when you are bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then shall you have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with you.
\[11]For whoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
\[12]Then said he also to him that bade him, When you make a dinner or a supper, call not your friends, nor your brothers, neither your kinsmen, nor your rich neighbors; lest they also bid you again, and a recompense be made you.
\[13]But when you make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
\[14]And you shall be blessed; for they cannot recompense you: for you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
\[15]And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
\[16]Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:
\[17]And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.
\[18]And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray you have me excused.
\[19]And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray you have me excused.
\[20]And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
\[21]So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
\[22]And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you have commanded, and yet there is room.
\[23]And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
\[24]For I say to you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.
\[25]And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said to them,
\[26]If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
\[27]And whoever does not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
\[28]For which of you, intending to build a tower, sits not down first, and counts the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
\[29]Lest haply, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,
\[30]Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
\[31]Or what king, going to make war against another king, sits not down first, and consults whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand?
\[32]Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an ambassador, and desires conditions of peace.
\[33]So likewise, whoever he be of you that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my disciple.
\[34]Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be seasoned?
\[35]It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.

hen drew near to him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
\[2]And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners, and eats with them.
\[3]And he spoke this parable to them, saying,
\[4]What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
\[5]And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
\[6]And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
\[7]I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.
\[8]Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?
\[9]And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
\[10]Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.
\[11]And he said, A certain man had two sons:
\[12]And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me. And he divided to them his living.
\[13]And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
\[14]And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
\[15]And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
\[16]And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave to him.
\[17]And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
\[18]I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before you,
\[19]And am no more worthy to be called your son: make me as one of your hired servants.
\[20]And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
\[21]And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight, and am no more worthy to be called your son.
\[22]But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
\[23]And bring here the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:
\[24]For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
\[25]Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
\[26]And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
\[27]And he said to him, Your brother is come; and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.
\[28]And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him.
\[29]And he answering said to his father, See, these many years do I serve you, neither transgressed I at any time your commandment: and yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
\[30]But as soon as this your son was come, which has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf.
\[31]And he said to him, Son, you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours.
\[32]It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

nd he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.
\[2]And he called him, and said to him, How is it that I hear this of you? give an account of your stewardship; for you may be no longer steward.
\[3]Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
\[4]I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
\[5]So he called every one of his lord's debtors to him, and said to the first, How much owe you to my lord?
\[6]And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
\[7]Then said he to another, And how much owe you? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill, and write fourscore.
\[8]And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
\[9]And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
\[10]He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
\[11]If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
\[12]And if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?
\[13]No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
\[14]And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
\[15]And he said to them, You are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
\[16]The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presses into it.
\[17]And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one pronunciation mark of the law to fail.
\[18]Whoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her that is put away from her husband commits adultery.
\[19]There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
\[20]And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
\[21]And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
\[22]And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
\[23]And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
\[24]And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
\[25]But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and you are tormented.
\[26]And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from there.
\[27]Then he said, I pray you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house:
\[28]For I have five brothers; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
\[29]Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
\[30]And he said, No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will repent.
\[31]And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

\[2]It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.
\[3]Take heed to yourselves: If your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
\[4]And if he trespass against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you, saying, I repent; you shall forgive him.
\[5]And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.
\[6]And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be you plucked up by the root, and be you planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
\[7]But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
\[8]And will not rather say to him, Make ready with which I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward you shall eat and drink?
\[9]Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
\[10]So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.
\[11]And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.
\[12]And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
\[13]And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
\[14]And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.
\[15]And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
\[16]And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
\[17]And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
\[18]There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.
\[19]And he said to him, Arise, go your way: your faith has made you whole.
\[20]And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:
\[21]Neither shall they say, See here! or, see there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
\[22]And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.
\[23]And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.
\[24]For as the lightning, that lightens out of the one part under heaven, shines to the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.
\[25]But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.
\[26]And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
\[27]They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
\[28]Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
\[29]But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
\[30]Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
\[31]In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
\[32]Remember Lot's wife.
\[33]Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
\[34]I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
\[35]Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\[36]Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\[37]And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.

nd he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
\[2]Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:
\[3]And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.
\[4]And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
\[5]Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
\[6]And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge said.
\[7]And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night to him, though he bear long with them?
\[8]I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?
\[9]And he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
\[10]Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
\[11]The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
\[12]I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
\[13]And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
\[14]I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
\[15]And they brought to him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\[16]But Jesus called them to him, and said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
\[17]Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
\[18]And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
\[19]And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.
\[20]You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.
\[21]And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
\[22]Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lack you one thing: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
\[23]And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
\[24]And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
\[25]For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\[26]And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?
\[27]And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
\[28]Then Peter said, See, we have left all, and followed you.
\[29]And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,
\[30]Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
\[31]Then he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
\[32]For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:
\[33]And they shall whip him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.
\[34]And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
\[35]And it came to pass, that as he was come near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
\[36]And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
\[37]And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passes by.
\[38]And he cried, saying, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.
\[39]And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, You son of David, have mercy on me.
\[40]And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
\[41]Saying, What will you that I shall do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
\[42]And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight: your faith has saved you.
\[43]And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

\[2]And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.
\[3]And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.
\[4]And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.
\[5]And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at your house.
\[6]And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
\[7]And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
\[8]And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.
\[9]And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, as much as he also is a son of Abraham.
\[10]For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
\[11]And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.
\[12]He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
\[13]And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said to them, Occupy till I come.
\[14]But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.
\[15]And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
\[16]Then came the first, saying, Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.
\[17]And he said to him, Well, you good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little, have you authority over ten cities.
\[18]And the second came, saying, Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.
\[19]And he said likewise to him, Be you also over five cities.
\[20]And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:
\[21]For I feared you, because you are an austere man: you take up that you layed not down, and reap that you did not sow.
\[22]And he said to him, Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:
\[23]Why then gave not you my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with usury?
\[24]And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.
\[25](And they said to him, Lord, he has ten pounds.)
\[26]For I say to you, That to every one which has shall be given; and from him that has not, even that he has shall be taken away from him.
\[27]But those my enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.
\[28]And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
\[29]And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
\[30]Saying, Go you into the village over against you; in the which at your entering you shall find a colt tied, where on yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him here.
\[31]And if any man ask you, Why do you loose him? thus shall you say to him, Because the Lord has need of him.
\[32]And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said to them.
\[33]And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them, Why loose you the colt?
\[34]And they said, The Lord has need of him.
\[35]And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments on the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
\[36]And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
\[37]And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;
\[38]Saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
\[39]And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke your disciples.
\[40]And he answered and said to them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
\[41]And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
\[42]Saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things which belong to your peace! but now they are hid from your eyes.
\[43]For the days shall come on you, that your enemies shall cast a trench about you, and compass you round, and keep you in on every side,
\[44]And shall lay you even with the ground, and your children within you; and they shall not leave in you one stone on another; because you knew not the time of your visitation.
\[45]And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;
\[46]Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves.
\[47]And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

\[4]The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?
\[5]And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed you him not?
\[6]But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.
\[7]And they answered, that they could not tell from where it was.
\[8]And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
\[9]Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to farmers, and went into a far country for a long time.
\[10]And at the season he sent a servant to the farmers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
\[11]And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
\[12]And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.
\[13]Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.
\[14]But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
\[15]So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?
\[16]He shall come and destroy these farmers, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
\[17]And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
\[18]Whoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
\[19]And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
\[20]And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.
\[21]And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:
\[22]Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?
\[23]But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why tempt you me?
\[24]Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said, Caesar's.
\[25]And he said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and to God the things which be God's.
\[26]And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.
\[27]Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
\[28]Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
\[29]There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
\[30]And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
\[31]And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
\[32]Last of all the woman died also.
\[33]Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
\[34]And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
\[35]But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
\[36]Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
\[37]Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
\[38]For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.
\[39]Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, you have well said.
\[40]And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.
\[41]And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David's son?
\[42]And David himself said in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,
\[43]Till I make your enemies your footstool.
\[44]David therefore calls him Lord, how is he then his son?
\[45]Then in the audience of all the people he said to his disciples,
\[46]Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
\[47]Which devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.

nd he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
\[2]And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
\[3]And he said, Of a truth I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than they all:
\[4]For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God: but she of her penury has cast in all the living that she had.
\[5]And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
\[6]As for these things which you behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.
\[7]And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be?  and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?
\[8]And he said, Take heed that you be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draws near: go you not therefore after them.
\[9]But when you shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.
\[10]Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
\[11]And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
\[12]But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.
\[13]And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
\[14]Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you shall answer:
\[15]For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
\[16]And you shall be betrayed both by parents, and brothers, and kinfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.
\[17]And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
\[18]But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
\[19]In your patience possess you your souls.
\[20]And when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is near.
\[21]Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the middle of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
\[22]For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
\[23]But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath on this people.
\[24]And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
\[25]And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
\[26]Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
\[27]And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\[28]And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.
\[29]And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
\[30]When they now shoot forth, you see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand.
\[31]So likewise you, when you see these things come to pass, know you that the kingdom of God is near at hand.
\[32]Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
\[33]Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
\[34]And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on you unawares.
\[35]For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
\[36]Watch you therefore, and pray always, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
\[37]And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.
\[38]And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.

ow the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
\[2]And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
\[3]Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
\[4]And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them.
\[5]And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
\[6]And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.
\[7]Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
\[8]And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.
\[9]And they said to him, Where will you that we prepare?
\[10]And he said to them, Behold, when you are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he enters in.
\[11]And you shall say to the manager of the house, The Master said to you, Where is the guest room, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
\[12]And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
\[13]And they went, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover.
\[14]And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
\[15]And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
\[16]For I say to you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
\[17]And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
\[18]For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
\[19]And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
\[20]Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
\[21]But, behold, the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table.
\[22]And truly the Son of man goes, as it was determined: but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!
\[23]And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
\[24]And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
\[25]And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority on them are called benefactors.
\[26]But you shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that does serve.
\[27]For whether is greater, he that sits at meat, or he that serves?  is not he that sits at meat? but I am among you as he that serves.
\[28]You are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
\[29]And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed to me;
\[30]That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\[31]And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:
\[32]But I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not: and when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.
\[33]And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you, both into prison, and to death.
\[34]And he said, I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that you shall thrice deny that you know me.
\[35]And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and money, and shoes, lacked you any thing? And they said, Nothing.
\[36]Then said he to them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his money: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
\[37]For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
\[38]And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.
\[39]And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
\[40]And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you enter not into temptation.
\[41]And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
\[42]Saying, Father, if you be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.
\[43]And there appeared an angel to him from heaven, strengthening him.
\[44]And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
\[45]And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
\[46]And said to them, Why sleep you? rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.
\[47]And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
\[48]But Jesus said to him, Judas, betray you the Son of man with a kiss?
\[49]When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
\[50]And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
\[51]And Jesus answered and said, Suffer you thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
\[52]Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be you come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?
\[53]When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
\[54]Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.
\[55]And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
\[56]But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked on him, and said, This man was also with him.
\[57]And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
\[58]And after a little while another saw him, and said, You are also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
\[59]And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
\[60]And Peter said, Man, I know not what you say. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crew.
\[61]And the Lord turned, and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.
\[62]And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
\[63]And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
\[64]And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote you?
\[65]And many other things blasphemously spoke they against him.
\[66]And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
\[67]Are you the Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe:
\[68]And if I also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.
\[69]Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
\[70]Then said they all, Are you then the Son of God? And he said to them, You say that I am.
\[71]And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

nd the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate.
\[2]And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
\[3]And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You say it.
\[4]Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
\[5]And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
\[6]When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
\[7]And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
\[8]And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
\[9]Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
\[10]And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
\[11]And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
\[12]And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
\[13]And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
\[14]Said to them, You have brought this man to me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof you accuse him:
\[15]No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, see, nothing worthy of death is done to him.
\[16]I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
\[17](For of necessity he must release one to them at the feast.)
\[18]And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:
\[19](Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
\[20]Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.
\[21]But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
\[22]And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
\[23]And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
\[24]And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
\[25]And he released to them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
\[26]And as they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
\[27]And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
\[28]But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
\[29]For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never gave suck.
\[30]Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
\[31]For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
\[32]And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
\[33]And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
\[34]Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
\[35]And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
\[36]And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
\[37]And saying, If you be the king of the Jews, save yourself.
\[38]And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[39]And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you be Christ, save yourself and us.
\[40]But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?
\[41]And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.
\[42]And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.
\[43]And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.
\[44]And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
\[45]And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the middle.
\[46]And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
\[47]Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
\[48]And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
\[49]And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
\[50]And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:
\[51](The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
\[52]This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
\[53]And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
\[54]And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
\[55]And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.
\[56]And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

ow on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
\[2]And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.
\[3]And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
\[4]And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
\[5]And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek you the living among the dead?
\[6]He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,
\[7]Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
\[8]And they remembered his words,
\[9]And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
\[10]It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.
\[11]And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
\[12]Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
\[13]And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.
\[14]And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
\[15]And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
\[16]But their eyes were held that they should not know him.
\[17]And he said to them, What manner of communications are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?
\[18]And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
\[19]And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
\[20]And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
\[21]But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
\[22]Yes, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulcher;
\[23]And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
\[24]And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
\[25]Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
\[26]Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
\[27]And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
\[28]And they drew near to the village, where they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
\[29]But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
\[30]And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.
\[31]And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
\[32]And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
\[33]And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
\[34]Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.
\[35]And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
\[36]And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.
\[37]But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
\[38]And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
\[39]Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.
\[40]And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.
\[41]And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here any meat?
\[42]And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
\[43]And he took it, and did eat before them.
\[44]And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
\[45]Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
\[46]And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
\[47]And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
\[48]And you are witnesses of these things.
\[49]And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.
\[50]And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
\[51]And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
\[52]And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
\[53]And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

\[2]The same was in the beginning with God.
\[3]All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
\[4]In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
\[5]And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
\[6]There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
\[7]The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
\[8]He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
\[9]That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.
\[10]He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
\[11]He came to his own, and his own received him not.
\[12]But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
\[13]Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\[14]And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
\[15]John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
\[16]And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.
\[17]For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
\[18]No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
\[19]And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?
\[20]And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
\[21]And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.
\[22]Then said they to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?
\[23]He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
\[24]And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
\[25]And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
\[26]John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;
\[27]He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.
\[28]These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\[29]The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.
\[30]This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
\[31]And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
\[32]And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.
\[33]And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.
\[34]And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.
\[35]Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
\[36]And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!
\[37]And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
\[38]Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What seek you? They said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwell you?
\[39]He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelled, and stayed with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
\[40]One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
\[41]He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
\[42]And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
\[43]The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.
\[44]Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\[45]Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
\[46]And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.
\[47]Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
\[48]Nathanael said to him, From where know you me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.
\[49]Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.
\[50]Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these.
\[51]And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.

nd the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
\[2]And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
\[3]And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.
\[4]Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.
\[5]His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.
\[6]And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
\[7]Jesus said to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
\[8]And he said to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore it.
\[9]When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
\[10]And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.
\[11]This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
\[12]After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
\[13]And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\[14]And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
\[15]And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
\[16]And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
\[17]And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.
\[18]Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign show you to us, seeing that you do these things?
\[19]Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
\[20]Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?
\[21]But he spoke of the temple of his body.
\[22]When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
\[23]Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
\[24]But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men,
\[25]And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.

here was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
\[2]The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.
\[3]Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
\[4]Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
\[5]Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
\[6]That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\[7]Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.
\[8]The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
\[9]Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?
\[10]Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things?
\[11]Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.
\[12]If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
\[13]And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
\[14]And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
\[15]That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
\[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
\[17]For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
\[18]He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\[19]And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
\[20]For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
\[21]But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.
\[22]After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
\[23]And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
\[24]For John was not yet cast into prison.
\[25]Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
\[26]And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.
\[27]John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
\[28]You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
\[29]He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
\[30]He must increase, but I must decrease.
\[31]He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.
\[32]And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.
\[33]He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.
\[34]For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.
\[35]The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
\[36]He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.

hen therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
\[2](Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
\[3]He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
\[4]And he must needs go through Samaria.
\[5]Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\[6]Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
\[7]There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.
\[8](For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)
\[9]Then said the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
\[10]Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.
\[11]The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then have you that living water?
\[12]Are you greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
\[13]Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:
\[14]But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
\[15]The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.
\[16]Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.
\[17]The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband:
\[18]For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that said you truly.
\[19]The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
\[20]Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
\[21]Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
\[22]You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
\[23]But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.
\[24]God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
\[25]The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
\[26]Jesus said to her, I that speak to you am he.
\[27]And on this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you? or, Why talk you with her?
\[28]The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and said to the men,
\[29]Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
\[30]Then they went out of the city, and came to him.
\[31]In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
\[32]But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.
\[33]Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him ought to eat?
\[34]Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
\[35]Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
\[36]And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.
\[37]And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.
\[38]I sent you to reap that where on you bestowed no labor: other men labored, and you are entered into their labors.
\[39]And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
\[40]So when the Samaritans were come to him, they sought him that he would tarry with them: and he stayed there two days.
\[41]And many more believed because of his own word;
\[42]And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.
\[43]Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galilee.
\[44]For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\[45]Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.
\[46]So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
\[47]When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and sought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
\[48]Then said Jesus to him, Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.
\[49]The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
\[50]Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.
\[51]And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives.
\[52]Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
\[53]So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.
\[54]This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.

fter this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\[2]Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
\[3]In these lay a great multitude of weak folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
\[4]For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.
\[5]And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
\[6]When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said to him, Will you be made whole?
\[7]The weak man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.
\[8]Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.
\[9]And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
\[10]The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
\[11]He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.
\[12]Then asked they him, What man is that which said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?
\[13]And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
\[14]Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.
\[15]The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
\[16]And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
\[17]But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.
\[18]Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
\[19]Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.
\[20]For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
\[21]For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.
\[22]For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:
\[23]That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.  He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.
\[24]Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.
\[25]Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
\[26]For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;
\[27]And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
\[28]Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
\[29]And shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.
\[30]I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.
\[31]If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
\[32]There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
\[33]You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.
\[34]But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.
\[35]He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
\[36]But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.
\[37]And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me.  You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
\[38]And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.
\[39]Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
\[40]And you will not come to me, that you might have life.
\[41]I receive not honor from men.
\[42]But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.
\[43]I am come in my Father's name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.
\[44]How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?
\[45]Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.
\[46]For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
\[47]But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?

fter these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
\[2]And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
\[3]And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
\[4]And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.
\[5]When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he said to Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
\[6]And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
\[7]Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
\[8]One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,
\[9]There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
\[10]And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
\[11]And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
\[12]When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
\[13]Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.
\[14]Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
\[15]When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
\[16]And when even was now come, his disciples went down to the sea,
\[17]And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
\[18]And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
\[19]So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid.
\[20]But he said to them, It is I; be not afraid.
\[21]Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.
\[22]The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one into where his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
\[23](However, there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
\[24]When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
\[25]And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when came you here?
\[26]Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
\[27]Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.
\[28]Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
\[29]Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.
\[30]They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?
\[31]Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
\[32]Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
\[33]For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.
\[34]Then said they to him, Lord, ever more give us this bread.
\[35]And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.
\[36]But I said to you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.
\[37]All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.
\[38]For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\[39]And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
\[40]And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\[41]The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
\[42]And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he said, I came down from heaven?
\[43]Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.
\[44]No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\[45]It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.  Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.
\[46]Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.
\[47]Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.
\[48]I am that bread of life.
\[49]Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
\[50]This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
\[51]I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
\[52]The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
\[53]Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
\[54]Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
\[55]For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
\[56]He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.
\[57]As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.
\[58]This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall live for ever.
\[59]These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\[60]Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
\[61]When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?
\[62]What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
\[63]It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.
\[64]But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
\[65]And he said, Therefore said I to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him of my Father.
\[66]From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
\[67]Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?
\[68]Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life.
\[69]And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.
\[70]Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
\[71]He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.

fter these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
\[2]Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.
\[3]His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do.
\[4]For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
\[5]For neither did his brothers believe in him.
\[6]Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.
\[7]The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
\[8]Go you up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast: for my time is not yet full come.
\[9]When he had said these words to them, he stayed still in Galilee.
\[10]But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
\[11]Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
\[12]And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.
\[13]However, no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
\[14]Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
\[15]And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?
\[16]Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
\[17]If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
\[18]He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
\[19]Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law?  Why go you about to kill me?
\[20]The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you?
\[21]Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.
\[22]Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
\[23]If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
\[24]Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
\[25]Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
\[26]But, see, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
\[27]However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.
\[28]Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.
\[29]But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me.
\[30]Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
\[31]And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done?
\[32]The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
\[33]Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.
\[34]You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.
\[35]Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
\[36]What manner of saying is this that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come?
\[37]In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
\[38]He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
\[39](But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
\[40]Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
\[41]Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
\[42]Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
\[43]So there was a division among the people because of him.
\[44]And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
\[45]Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?
\[46]The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.
\[47]Then answered them the Pharisees, Are you also deceived?
\[48]Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
\[49]But this people who knows not the law are cursed.
\[50]Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
\[51]Does our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he does?
\[52]They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.
\[53]And every man went to his own house.

esus went to the mount of Olives.
\[2]And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.
\[3]And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the middle,
\[4]They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
\[5]Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?
\[6]This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
\[7]So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
\[8]And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
\[9]And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.
\[10]When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you?
\[11]She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.
\[12]Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
\[13]The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.
\[14]Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know from where I came, and where I go; but you cannot tell from where I come, and where I go.
\[15]You judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
\[16]And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
\[17]It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
\[18]I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.
\[19]Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.
\[20]These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
\[21]Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.
\[22]Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he said, Where I go, you cannot come.
\[23]And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.
\[24]I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.
\[25]Then said they to him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.
\[26]I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
\[27]They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.
\[28]Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.
\[29]And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
\[30]As he spoke these words, many believed on him.
\[31]Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;
\[32]And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
\[33]They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?
\[34]Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.
\[35]And the servant stays not in the house for ever: but the Son stays ever.
\[36]If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
\[37]I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
\[38]I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.
\[39]They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.
\[40]But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
\[41]You do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.
\[42]Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
\[43]Why do you not understand my speech? even because you cannot hear my word.
\[44]You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
\[45]And because I tell you the truth, you believe me not.
\[46]Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?
\[47]He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.
\[48]Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?
\[49]Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and you do dishonor me.
\[50]And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeks and judges.
\[51]Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
\[52]Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that you have a devil.  Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
\[53]Are you greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom make you yourself?
\[54]Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honors me; of whom you say, that he is your God:
\[55]Yet you have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like to you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
\[56]Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.
\[57]Then said the Jews to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
\[58]Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.
\[59]Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.

nd as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
\[2]And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
\[3]Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
\[4]I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.
\[5]As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
\[6]When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
\[7]And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
\[8]The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
\[9]Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
\[10]Therefore said they to him, How were your eyes opened?
\[11]He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
\[12]Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
\[13]They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
\[14]And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
\[15]Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and do see.
\[16]Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
\[17]They say to the blind man again, What say you of him, that he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
\[18]But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
\[19]And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see?
\[20]His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
\[21]But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
\[22]These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\[23]Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
\[24]Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
\[25]He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
\[26]Then said they to him again, What did he to you? how opened he your eyes?
\[27]He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear: why would you hear it again? will you also be his disciples?
\[28]Then they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
\[29]We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from where he is.
\[30]The man answered and said to them, Why herein is a marvelous thing, that you know not from where he is, and yet he has opened my eyes.
\[31]Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and does his will, him he hears.
\[32]Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
\[33]If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
\[34]They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.
\[35]Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?
\[36]He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
\[37]And Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he that talks with you.
\[38]And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
\[39]And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
\[40]And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?
\[41]Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.

ruly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
\[2]But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
\[3]To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
\[4]And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
\[5]And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
\[6]This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.
\[7]Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
\[8]All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
\[9]I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
\[10]The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
\[11]I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
\[12]But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.
\[13]The hireling flees, because he is an hireling, and cares not for the sheep.
\[14]I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
\[15]As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\[16]And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
\[17]Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
\[18]No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
\[19]There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
\[20]And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you him?
\[21]Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
\[22]And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
\[23]And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
\[24]Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long do you make us to doubt? If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.
\[25]Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
\[26]But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, as I said to you.
\[27]My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
\[28]And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
\[29]My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.
\[30]I and my Father are one.
\[31]Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
\[32]Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?
\[33]The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.
\[34]Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?
\[35]If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
\[36]Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?
\[37]If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
\[38]But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
\[39]Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
\[40]And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.
\[41]And many resorted to him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.
\[42]And many believed on him there.

ow a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
\[2](It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
\[3]Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.
\[4]When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
\[5]Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
\[6]When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he stayed two days still in the same place where he was.
\[7]Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
\[8]His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?
\[9]Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.
\[10]But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.
\[11]These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
\[12]Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
\[13]However, Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
\[14]Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
\[15]And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go to him.
\[16]Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
\[17]Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
\[18]Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
\[19]And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\[20]Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
\[21]Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.
\[22]But I know, that even now, whatever you will ask of God, God will give it you.
\[23]Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.
\[24]Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
\[25]Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
\[26]And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?
\[27]She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
\[28]And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calls for you.
\[29]As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came to him.
\[30]Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
\[31]The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes to the grave to weep there.
\[32]Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.
\[33]When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.
\[34]And said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see.
\[35]Jesus wept.
\[36]Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
\[37]And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
\[38]Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay on it.
\[39]Jesus said, Take you away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said to him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days.
\[40]Jesus said to her, Said I not to you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?
\[41]Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
\[42]And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.
\[43]And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
\[44]And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them, Loose him, and let him go.
\[45]Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
\[46]But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
\[47]Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles.
\[48]If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
\[49]And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,
\[50]Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
\[51]And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
\[52]And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
\[53]Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
\[54]Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
\[55]And the Jews' passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
\[56]Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think you, that he will not come to the feast?
\[57]Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.

hen Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
\[2]There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
\[3]Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
\[4]Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,
\[5]Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
\[6]This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.
\[7]Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this.
\[8]For the poor always you have with you; but me you have not always.
\[9]Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
\[10]But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
\[11]Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
\[12]On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\[13]Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.
\[14]And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
\[15]Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.
\[16]These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
\[17]The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record.
\[18]For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
\[19]The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive you how you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
\[20]And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
\[21]The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
\[22]Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
\[23]And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
\[24]Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.
\[25]He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.
\[26]If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.
\[27]Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.
\[28]Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
\[29]The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.
\[30]Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
\[31]Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
\[32]And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.
\[33]This he said, signifying what death he should die.
\[34]The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
\[35]Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you.  Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.
\[36]While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
\[37]But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
\[38]That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
\[39]Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
\[40]He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
\[41]These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
\[42]Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
\[43]For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
\[44]Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.
\[45]And he that sees me sees him that sent me.
\[46]I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.
\[47]And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
\[48]He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
\[49]For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
\[50]And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak.

ow before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.
\[2]And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
\[3]Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
\[4]He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
\[5]After that he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
\[6]Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?
\[7]Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.
\[8]Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.
\[9]Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
\[10]Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.
\[11]For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, You are not all clean.
\[12]So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done to you?
\[13]You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.
\[14]If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.
\[15]For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
\[16]Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
\[17]If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.
\[18]I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
\[19]Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.
\[20]Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.
\[21]When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.
\[22]Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.
\[23]Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
\[24]Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.
\[25]He then lying on Jesus' breast said to him, Lord, who is it?
\[26]Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
\[27]And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.
\[28]Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.
\[29]For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
\[30]He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
\[31]Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\[32]If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
\[33]Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.
\[34]A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
\[35]By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.
\[36]Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where go you? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.
\[37]Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.
\[38]Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied me thrice.

\[3]And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.
\[4]And where I go you know, and the way you know.
\[5]Thomas said to him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?
\[6]Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.
\[7]If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from now on you know him, and have seen him.
\[8]Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.
\[9]Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?
\[10]Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.
\[11]Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
\[12]Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.
\[13]And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\[14]If you shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
\[15]If you love me, keep my commandments.
\[16]And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
\[17]Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.
\[18]I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
\[19]Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.
\[20]At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
\[21]He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
\[22]Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?
\[23]Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.
\[24]He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
\[25]These things have I spoken to you, being yet present with you.
\[26]But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.
\[27]Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
\[28]You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
\[29]And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you might believe.
\[30]Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.
\[31]But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

 am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.
\[2]Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
\[3]Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.
\[4]Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.
\[5]I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.
\[6]If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
\[7]If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.
\[8]Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.
\[9]As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you in my love.
\[10]If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
\[11]These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.
\[12]This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.
\[13]Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
\[14]You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
\[15]From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.
\[16]You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
\[17]These things I command you, that you love one another.
\[18]If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.
\[19]If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
\[20]Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
\[21]But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.
\[22]If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.
\[23]He that hates me hates my Father also.
\[24]If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
\[25]But this comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
\[26]But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:

\[4]But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you.
\[5]But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asks me, Where go you?
\[6]But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
\[7]Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.
\[8]And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
\[9]Of sin, because they believe not on me;
\[10]Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;
\[11]Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
\[12]I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
\[13]However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.
\[14]He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it to you.
\[15]All things that the Father has are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it to you.
\[16]A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.
\[17]Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
\[18]They said therefore, What is this that he said, A little while? we cannot tell what he said.
\[19]Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?
\[20]Truly, truly, I say to you, That you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
\[21]A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
\[22]And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.
\[23]And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
\[24]Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.
\[25]These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.
\[26]At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:
\[27]For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
\[28]I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
\[29]His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.
\[30]Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.
\[31]Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?
\[32]Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

\[3]And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
\[4]I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.
\[5]And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.
\[6]I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.

\[14]I have given them your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\[15]I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.
\[16]They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

\[19]And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
\[20]Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
\[21]That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.
\[22]And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
\[23]I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.
\[24]Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
\[25]O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.

hen Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
\[2]And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.
\[3]Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
\[4]Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come on him, went forth, and said to them, Whom seek you?
\[5]They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he.  And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
\[6]As soon then as he had said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
\[7]Then asked he them again, Whom seek you? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
\[8]Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore you seek me, let these go their way:
\[9]That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of them which you gave me have I lost none.
\[10]Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
\[11]Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?
\[12]Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
\[13]And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
\[14]Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
\[15]And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
\[16]But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known to the high priest, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
\[17]Then said the damsel that kept the door to Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He said, I am not.
\[18]And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
\[19]The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
\[20]Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
\[21]Why ask you me? ask them which heard me, what I have said to them: behold, they know what I said.
\[22]And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answer you the high priest so?
\[23]Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smite you me?
\[24]Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
\[25]And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore to him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
\[26]One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did not I see you in the garden with him?
\[27]Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
\[28]Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
\[29]Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation bring you against this man?
\[30]They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to you.
\[31]Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
\[32]That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.
\[33]Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?
\[34]Jesus answered him, Say you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?
\[35]Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me: what have you done?
\[36]Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
\[37]Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.
\[38]Pilate said to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find in him no fault at all.
\[39]But you have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?
\[40]Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

hen Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
\[2]And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
\[3]And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
\[4]Pilate therefore went forth again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.
\[5]Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man!
\[6]When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Take you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
\[7]The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
\[8]When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
\[9]And went again into the judgment hall, and said to Jesus, From where are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.
\[10]Then said Pilate to him, Speak you not to me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?
\[11]Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.
\[12]And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.
\[13]When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\[14]And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he said to the Jews, Behold your King!
\[15]But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.  Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
\[16]Then delivered he him therefore to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
\[17]And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
\[18]Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
\[19]And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\[20]This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
\[21]Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
\[22]Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
\[23]Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\[24]They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, They parted my raiment among them, and for my clothing they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
\[25]Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
\[26]When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!
\[27]Then said he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.
\[28]After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.
\[29]Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
\[30]When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
\[31]The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) sought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
\[32]Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
\[33]But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:
\[34]But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.
\[35]And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.
\[36]For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
\[37]And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
\[38]And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, sought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
\[39]And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
\[40]Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
\[41]Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.
\[42]There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulcher was near at hand.

he first day of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, to the sepulcher, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher.
\[2]Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.
\[3]Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.
\[4]So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.
\[5]And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
\[6]Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,
\[7]And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
\[8]Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.
\[9]For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
\[10]Then the disciples went away again to their own home.
\[11]But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,
\[12]And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\[13]And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.
\[14]And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
\[15]Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.
\[16]Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned herself, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
\[17]Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.
\[18]Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things to her.
\[19]Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.
\[20]And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side.  Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.
\[21]Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.
\[22]And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:
\[23]Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.
\[24]But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
\[25]The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD.  But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
\[26]And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.
\[27]Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
\[28]And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.
\[29]Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.
\[30]And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
\[31]But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.

fter these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.
\[2]There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
\[3]Simon Peter said to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
\[4]But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
\[5]Then Jesus said to them, Children, have you any meat? They answered him, No.
\[6]And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
\[7]Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat to him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
\[8]And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
\[9]As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
\[10]Jesus said to them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught.
\[11]Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
\[12]Jesus said to them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.
\[13]Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.
\[14]This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
\[15]So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.
\[16]He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.
\[17]He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Love you me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.
\[18]Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.
\[19]This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him, Follow me.
\[20]Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you?
\[21]Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
\[22]Jesus said to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me.
\[23]Then went this saying abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?
\[24]This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
\[25]And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.

he former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
\[2]Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen:
\[3]To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
\[4]And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.
\[5]For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.
\[6]When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
\[7]And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.
\[8]But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.
\[9]And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
\[10]And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
\[11]Which also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.
\[12]Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.
\[13]And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.
\[14]These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
\[15]And in those days Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
\[16]Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.
\[17]For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
\[18]Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.
\[19]And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; so as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
\[20]For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his position as bishop let another take.
\[21]Why of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
\[22]Beginning from the baptism of John, to that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.
\[23]And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
\[24]And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,
\[25]That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
\[26]And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

nd when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
\[2]And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
\[3]And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them.
\[4]And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
\[5]And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
\[6]Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
\[7]And they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
\[8]And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?
\[9]Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
\[10]Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
\[11]Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
\[12]And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What means this?
\[13]Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
\[14]But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my words:
\[15]For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
\[16]But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
\[17]And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
\[18]And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
\[19]And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:
\[20]The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:
\[21]And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\[22]You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the middle of you, as you yourselves also know:
\[23]Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:
\[24]Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.
\[25]For David speaks concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
\[26]Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
\[27]Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.
\[28]You have made known to me the ways of life; you shall make me full of joy with your countenance.
\[29]Men and brothers, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.
\[30]Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
\[31]He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
\[32]This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
\[33]Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.
\[34]For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he said himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,
\[35]Until I make your foes your footstool.
\[36]Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
\[37]Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?
\[38]Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
\[39]For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.
\[40]And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
\[41]Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.
\[42]And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
\[43]And fear came on every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
\[44]And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
\[45]And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
\[46]And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
\[47]Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

ow Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.
\[2]And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
\[3]Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
\[4]And Peter, fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us.
\[5]And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something of them.
\[6]Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
\[7]And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
\[8]And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
\[9]And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
\[10]And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.
\[11]And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.
\[12]And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
\[13]The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.
\[14]But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;
\[15]And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
\[16]And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
\[17]And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers.
\[18]But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled.
\[19]Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.
\[20]And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached to you:
\[21]Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
\[22]For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.
\[23]And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
\[24]Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
\[25]You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
\[26]To you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

nd as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,
\[2]Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
\[3]And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold to the next day: for it was now eventide.
\[4]However, many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
\[5]And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
\[6]And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
\[7]And when they had set them in the middle, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have you done this?
\[8]Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them, You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
\[9]If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the weak man, by what means he is made whole;
\[10]Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him does this man stand here before you whole.
\[11]This is the stone which was set at nothing of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
\[12]Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
\[13]Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
\[14]And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
\[15]But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
\[16]Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
\[17]But that it spread no further among the people, let us straightly threaten them, that they speak from now on to no man in this name.
\[18]And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
\[19]But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge you.
\[20]For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
\[21]So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.
\[22]For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was showed.
\[23]And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
\[24]And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
\[25]Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
\[26]The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
\[27]For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,
\[28]For to do whatever your hand and your counsel determined before to be done.
\[29]And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant to your servants, that with all boldness they may speak your word,
\[30]By stretching forth your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of your holy child Jesus.
\[31]And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
\[32]And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
\[33]And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was on them all.
\[34]Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
\[35]And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made to every man according as he had need.
\[36]And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,
\[37]Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

ut a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
\[2]And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
\[3]But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
\[4]Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart?  you have not lied to men, but to God.
\[5]And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.
\[6]And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.
\[7]And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
\[8]And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.
\[9]Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out.
\[10]Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.
\[11]And great fear came on all the church, and on as many as heard these things.
\[12]And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders worked among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
\[13]And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.
\[14]And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)
\[15]So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
\[16]There came also a multitude out of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
\[17]Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,
\[18]And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
\[19]But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
\[20]Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
\[21]And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\[22]But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,
\[23]Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
\[24]Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.
\[25]Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
\[26]Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
\[27]And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,
\[28]Saying, Did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name? and, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood on us.
\[29]Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.
\[30]The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.
\[31]Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
\[32]And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God has given to them that obey him.
\[33]When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.
\[34]Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;
\[35]And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.
\[36]For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.
\[37]After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
\[38]And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:
\[39]But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it; lest haply you be found even to fight against God.
\[40]And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\[41]And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
\[42]And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

nd in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
\[2]Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
\[3]Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\[4]But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
\[5]And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
\[6]Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
\[7]And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
\[8]And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
\[9]Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.
\[10]And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.
\[11]Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.
\[12]And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came on him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,
\[13]And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
\[14]For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
\[15]And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

hen said the high priest, Are these things so?
\[2]And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,
\[3]And said to him, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I shall show you.
\[4]Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.
\[5]And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
\[6]And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.
\[7]And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
\[8]And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.
\[9]And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
\[10]And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
\[11]Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
\[12]But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
\[13]And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers; and Joseph's kindred was made known to Pharaoh.
\[14]Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, three score and fifteen souls.
\[15]So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
\[16]And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.
\[17]But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\[18]Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
\[19]The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
\[20]In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:
\[21]And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
\[22]And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
\[23]And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel.
\[24]And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
\[25]For he supposed his brothers would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
\[26]And the next day he showed himself to them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brothers; why do you wrong one to another?
\[27]But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
\[28]Will you kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?
\[29]Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
\[30]And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
\[31]When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came to him,
\[32]Saying, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not behold.
\[33]Then said the Lord to him, Put off your shoes from your feet: for the place where you stand is holy ground.
\[34]I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you into Egypt.
\[35]This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.
\[36]He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
\[37]This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear.
\[38]This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:
\[39]To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
\[40]Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\[41]And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
\[42]Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
\[43]Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
\[44]Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
\[45]Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;
\[46]Who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
\[47]But Solomon built him an house.
\[48]However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,
\[49]Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will you build me? said the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?
\[50]Has not my hand made all these things?
\[51]You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.
\[52]Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:
\[53]Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.
\[54]When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
\[55]But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
\[56]And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
\[57]Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran on him with one accord,
\[58]And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.
\[59]And they stoned Stephen, calling on God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
\[60]And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

nd Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\[2]And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
\[3]As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.
\[4]Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
\[5]Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.
\[6]And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
\[7]For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
\[8]And there was great joy in that city.
\[9]But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
\[10]To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
\[11]And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
\[12]But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
\[13]Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
\[14]Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:
\[15]Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
\[16](For as yet he was fallen on none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
\[17]Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
\[18]And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
\[19]Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
\[20]But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
\[21]You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God.
\[22]Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
\[23]For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
\[24]Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.
\[25]And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
\[26]And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.
\[27]And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
\[28]Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
\[29]Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.
\[30]And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understand you what you read?
\[31]And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
\[32]The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
\[33]In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
\[34]And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
\[35]Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.
\[36]And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what does hinder me to be baptized?
\[37]And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may.  And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
\[38]And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
\[39]And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
\[40]But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

nd Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
\[2]And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
\[3]And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
\[4]And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?
\[5]And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.
\[6]And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do? And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.
\[7]And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
\[8]And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
\[9]And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
\[10]And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
\[11]And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,
\[12]And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
\[13]Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:
\[14]And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.
\[15]But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
\[16]For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
\[17]And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
\[18]And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight immediately, and arose, and was baptized.
\[19]And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
\[20]And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
\[21]But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came here for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?
\[22]But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelled at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
\[23]And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
\[24]But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
\[25]Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.
\[26]And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
\[27]But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
\[28]And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
\[29]And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
\[30]Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
\[31]Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
\[32]And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda.
\[33]And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
\[34]And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.
\[35]And all that dwelled at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
\[36]Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.
\[37]And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.
\[38]And for as much as Lydda was near to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent to him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.
\[39]Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
\[40]But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
\[41]And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
\[42]And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.

\[2]A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.
\[3]He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
\[4]And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?  And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms are come up for a memorial before God.

\[8]And when he had declared all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
\[9]On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
\[10]And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
\[11]And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
\[12]Wherein were all manner of four footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
\[13]And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
\[14]But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
\[15]And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.
\[16]This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
\[17]Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,
\[18]And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
\[19]While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.
\[20]Arise therefore, and get you down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
\[21]Then Peter went down to the men which were sent to him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause why you are come?
\[22]And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words of you.
\[23]Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
\[24]And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
\[25]And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
\[26]But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
\[27]And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
\[28]And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
\[29]Therefore came I to you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent you have sent for me?
\[30]And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
\[31]And said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
\[32]Send therefore to Joppa, and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he comes, shall speak to you.
\[33]Immediately therefore I sent to you; and you have well done that you are come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded you of God.
\[34]Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
\[35]But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him.
\[36]The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
\[37]That word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
\[38]How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
\[39]And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
\[40]Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;
\[41]Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
\[42]And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.
\[43]To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins.
\[44]While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
\[45]And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
\[46]For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
\[47]Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
\[48]And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

nd the apostles and brothers that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
\[2]And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
\[3]Saying, You went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them.
\[4]But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order to them, saying,
\[5]I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
\[6]On the which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw four footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
\[7]And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
\[8]But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.
\[9]But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.
\[10]And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
\[11]And, behold, immediately there were three men already come to the house where I was, sent from Caesarea to me.
\[12]And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:
\[13]And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
\[14]Who shall tell you words, whereby you and all your house shall be saved.
\[15]And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
\[16]Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
\[17]For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?
\[18]When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life.
\[19]Now they which were scattered abroad on the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.
\[20]And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.
\[21]And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.
\[22]Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
\[23]Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would hold to the Lord.
\[24]For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added to the Lord.
\[25]Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:
\[26]And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
\[27]And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.
\[28]And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
\[29]Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:
\[30]Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

ow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
\[2]And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
\[3]And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
\[4]And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
\[5]Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church to God for him.
\[6]And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
\[7]And, behold, the angel of the Lord came on him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
\[8]And the angel said to him, Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals.  And so he did. And he said to him, Cast your garment about you, and follow me.
\[9]And he went out, and followed him; and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
\[10]When they were past the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him.
\[11]And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD has sent his angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
\[12]And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.
\[13]And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to listen, named Rhoda.
\[14]And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
\[15]And they said to her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.
\[16]But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.
\[17]But he, beckoning to them with the hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things to James, and to the brothers. And he departed, and went into another place.
\[18]Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
\[19]And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there stayed.
\[20]And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.
\[21]And on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne, and made an oration to them.
\[22]And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.
\[23]And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
\[24]But the word of God grew and multiplied.
\[25]And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.

ow there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
\[2]As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
\[3]And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
\[4]So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
\[5]And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.
\[6]And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:
\[7]Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
\[8]But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
\[9]Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him.
\[10]And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
\[11]And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
\[12]Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
\[13]Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
\[14]But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
\[15]And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
\[16]Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, give audience.
\[17]The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelled as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
\[18]And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
\[19]And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
\[20]And after that he gave to them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
\[21]And afterward they desired a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
\[22]And when he had removed him, he raised up to them David to be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, which shall fulfill all my will.
\[23]Of this man's seed has God according to his promise raised to Israel a Savior, Jesus:
\[24]When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\[25]And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think you that I am?  I am not he. But, behold, there comes one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.
\[26]Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
\[27]For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
\[28]And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
\[29]And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.
\[30]But God raised him from the dead:
\[31]And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
\[32]And we declare to you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made to the fathers,
\[33]God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.
\[34]And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
\[35]Why he said also in another psalm, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption.
\[36]For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:
\[37]But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
\[38]Be it known to you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:
\[39]And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
\[40]Beware therefore, lest that come on you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
\[41]Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it to you.
\[42]And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles sought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
\[43]Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
\[44]And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
\[45]But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
\[46]Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.
\[47]For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set you to be a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.
\[48]And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
\[49]And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
\[50]But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.
\[51]But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
\[52]And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

nd it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
\[2]But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brothers.
\[3]Long time therefore stayed they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
\[4]But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
\[5]And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them spitefully, and to stone them,
\[6]They were ware of it, and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the region that lies round about:
\[7]And there they preached the gospel.
\[8]And there sat a certain man at Lystra, weak in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:
\[9]The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
\[10]Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped and walked.
\[11]And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
\[12]And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
\[13]Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
\[14]Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
\[15]And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:
\[16]Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
\[17]Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
\[18]And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice to them.
\[19]And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.
\[20]However,, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
\[21]And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,
\[22]Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
\[23]And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
\[24]And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
\[25]And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
\[26]And there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
\[27]And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
\[28]And there they stayed long time with the disciples.

nd certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.
\[2]When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.
\[3]And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.
\[4]And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
\[5]But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
\[6]And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.
\[7]And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
\[8]And God, which knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did to us;
\[9]And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
\[10]Now therefore why tempt you God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\[11]But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
\[12]Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the Gentiles by them.
\[13]And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:
\[14]Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
\[15]And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
\[16]After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
\[17]That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, on whom my name is called, said the Lord, who does all these things.
\[18]Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
\[19]Why my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
\[20]But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
\[21]For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
\[22]Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:
\[23]And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.
\[24]For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
\[25]It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\[26]Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[27]We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.
\[28]For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things;
\[29]That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.
\[30]So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter:
\[31]Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
\[32]And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.
\[33]And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brothers to the apostles.
\[34]Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
\[35]Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
\[36]And some days after Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.
\[37]And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
\[38]But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
\[39]And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;
\[40]And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brothers to the grace of God.
\[41]And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

hen came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:
\[2]Which was well reported of by the brothers that were at Lystra and Iconium.
\[3]Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.
\[4]And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.
\[5]And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
\[6]Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,
\[7]After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.
\[8]And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
\[9]And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
\[10]And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel to them.
\[11]Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
\[12]And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
\[13]And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.
\[14]And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.
\[15]And when she was baptized, and her household, she sought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.
\[16]And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
\[17]The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation.
\[18]And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.  And he came out the same hour.
\[19]And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace to the rulers,
\[20]And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
\[21]And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
\[22]And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.
\[23]And when they had laid many stripes on them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
\[24]Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
\[25]And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them.
\[26]And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
\[27]And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
\[28]But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here.
\[29]Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
\[30]And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
\[31]And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.
\[32]And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
\[33]And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
\[34]And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
\[35]And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
\[36]And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.
\[37]But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
\[38]And the sergeants told these words to the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.
\[39]And they came and sought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.
\[40]And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.

ow when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
\[2]And Paul, as his manner was, went in to them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
\[3]Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ.
\[4]And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
\[5]But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
\[6]And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brothers to the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come here also;
\[7]Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.
\[8]And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
\[9]And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
\[10]And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
\[11]These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
\[12]Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
\[13]But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
\[14]And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.
\[15]And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.
\[16]Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
\[17]Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
\[18]Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection.
\[19]And they took him, and brought him to Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you speak, is?
\[20]For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
\[21](For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
\[22]Then Paul stood in the middle of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.
\[23]For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.
\[24]God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;
\[25]Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;
\[26]And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
\[27]That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
\[28]For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
\[29]For as much then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold, or silver, or stone, graven by are and man's device.
\[30]And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:
\[31]Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.
\[32]And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.
\[33]So Paul departed from among them.
\[34]However, certain men joined to him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

fter these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
\[2]And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.
\[3]And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
\[4]And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
\[5]And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.
\[6]And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go to the Gentiles.
\[7]And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
\[8]And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
\[9]Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:
\[10]For I am with you, and no man shall set on you to hurt you: for I have much people in this city.
\[11]And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\[12]And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
\[13]Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
\[14]And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
\[15]But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.
\[16]And he drove them from the judgment seat.
\[17]Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
\[18]And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
\[19]And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
\[20]When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;
\[21]But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
\[22]And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
\[23]And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
\[24]And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
\[25]This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
\[26]And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.
\[27]And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
\[28]For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

nd it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,
\[2]He said to them, Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?  And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
\[3]And he said to them, To what then were you baptized? And they said, To John's baptism.
\[4]Then said Paul, John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
\[5]When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\[6]And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
\[7]And all the men were about twelve.
\[8]And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
\[9]But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
\[10]And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
\[11]And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:
\[12]So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
\[13]Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.
\[14]And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.
\[15]And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?
\[16]And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\[17]And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
\[18]And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.
\[19]Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
\[20]So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
\[21]After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
\[22]So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
\[23]And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
\[24]For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;
\[25]Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth.
\[26]Moreover you see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:
\[27]So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nothing; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.
\[28]And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
\[29]And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
\[30]And when Paul would have entered in to the people, the disciples suffered him not.
\[31]And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent to him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.
\[32]Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not why they were come together.
\[33]And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.
\[34]But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
\[35]And when the town cleark had appeased the people, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there that knows not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
\[36]Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
\[37]For you have brought here these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
\[38]Why if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them accuse one another.
\[39]But if you inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
\[40]For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.
\[41]And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

nd after the uproar was ceased, Paul called to him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.
\[2]And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,
\[3]And there stayed three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.
\[4]And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
\[5]These going before tarried for us at Troas.
\[6]And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.
\[7]And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
\[8]And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.
\[9]And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.
\[10]And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.
\[11]When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
\[12]And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
\[13]And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.
\[14]And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
\[15]And we sailed there, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.
\[16]For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hurried, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
\[17]And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
\[18]And when they were come to him, he said to them, You know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
\[19]Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:
\[20]And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,
\[21]Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[22]And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
\[23]Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
\[24]But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
\[25]And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
\[26]Why I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.
\[27]For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.
\[28]Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.
\[29]For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
\[30]Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
\[31]Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
\[32]And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
\[33]I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.
\[34]Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me.
\[35]I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
\[36]And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
\[37]And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,
\[38]Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.

nd it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the day following to Rhodes, and from there to Patara:
\[2]And finding a ship sailing over to Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
\[3]Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
\[4]And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
\[5]And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
\[6]And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
\[7]And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brothers, and stayed with them one day.
\[8]And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.
\[9]And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
\[10]And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
\[11]And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
\[12]And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, sought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\[13]Then Paul answered, What mean you to weep and to break my heart?  for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
\[14]And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
\[15]And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.
\[16]There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
\[17]And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
\[18]And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.
\[19]And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had worked among the Gentiles by his ministry.
\[20]And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
\[21]And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.
\[22]What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that you are come.
\[23]Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;
\[24]Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.
\[25]As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
\[26]Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
\[27]And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
\[28]Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.
\[29](For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
\[30]And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut.
\[31]And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
\[32]Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.
\[33]Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
\[34]And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
\[35]And when he came on the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
\[36]For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
\[37]And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to you? Who said, Can you speak Greek?
\[38]Are not you that Egyptian, which before these days made an uproar, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
\[39]But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech you, suffer me to speak to the people.
\[40]And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,

en, brothers, and fathers, hear you my defense which I make now to you.
\[2](And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he said,)
\[3]I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.
\[4]And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
\[5]As also the high priest does bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound to Jerusalem, for to be punished.
\[6]And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come near to Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
\[7]And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?
\[8]And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.
\[9]And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me.
\[10]And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told you of all things which are appointed for you to do.
\[11]And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
\[12]And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelled there,
\[13]Came to me, and stood, and said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked up on him.
\[14]And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.
\[15]For you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
\[16]And now why tarry you? arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
\[17]And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
\[18]And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get you quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.
\[19]And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on you:
\[20]And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
\[21]And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you far hence to the Gentiles.
\[22]And they gave him audience to this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
\[23]And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,
\[24]The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know why they cried so against him.
\[25]And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
\[26]When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what you do: for this man is a Roman.
\[27]Then the chief captain came, and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes.
\[28]And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
\[29]Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
\[30]On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

nd Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
\[2]And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
\[3]Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?
\[4]And they that stood by said, Revile you God's high priest?
\[5]Then said Paul, I knew not, brothers, that he was the high priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.
\[6]But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
\[7]And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
\[8]For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
\[9]And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
\[10]And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.
\[11]And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.
\[12]And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
\[13]And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
\[14]And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
\[15]Now therefore you with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down to you to morrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
\[16]And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
\[17]Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Bring this young man to the chief captain: for he has a certain thing to tell him.
\[18]So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and prayed me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.
\[19]Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that you have to tell me?
\[20]And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire you that you would bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
\[21]But do not you yield to them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from you.
\[22]So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See you tell no man that you have showed these things to me.
\[23]And he called to him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen three score and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
\[24]And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe to Felix the governor.
\[25]And he wrote a letter after this manner:
\[26]Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix sends greeting.
\[27]This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
\[28]And when I would have known the cause why they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:
\[29]Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
\[30]And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to you, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell.
\[31]Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
\[32]On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
\[33]Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
\[34]And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;
\[35]I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

nd after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
\[2]And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by your providence,
\[3]We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
\[4]Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious to you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words.
\[5]For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
\[6]Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.
\[7]But the chief captain Lysias came on us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,
\[8]Commanding his accusers to come to you: by examining of whom yourself may take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
\[9]And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
\[10]Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, For as much as I know that you have been of many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:
\[11]Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
\[12]And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
\[13]Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
\[14]But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
\[15]And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
\[16]And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.
\[17]Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
\[18]Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
\[19]Who ought to have been here before you, and object, if they had ought against me.
\[20]Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
\[21]Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.
\[22]And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.
\[23]And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come to him.
\[24]And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
\[25]And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.
\[26]He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: why he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
\[27]But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

ow when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
\[2]Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and sought him,
\[3]And desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
\[4]But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.
\[5]Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
\[6]And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
\[7]And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
\[8]While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.
\[9]But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
\[10]Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as you very well know.
\[11]For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.
\[12]Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed to Caesar? to Caesar shall you go.
\[13]And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to salute Festus.
\[14]And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause to the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
\[15]About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.
\[16]To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
\[17]Therefore, when they were come here, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
\[18]Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:
\[19]But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
\[20]And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
\[21]But when Paul had appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
\[22]Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, you shall hear him.
\[23]And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.
\[24]And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
\[25]But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
\[26]Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Why I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
\[27]For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not with to signify the crimes laid against him.

hen Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself.  Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
\[2]I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before you touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:
\[3]Especially because I know you to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: why I beseech you to hear me patiently.
\[4]My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
\[5]Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strait sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
\[6]And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, to our fathers:
\[7]To which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
\[8]Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
\[9]I truly thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
\[10]Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
\[11]And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to strange cities.
\[12]Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
\[13]At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.
\[14]And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.
\[15]And I said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.
\[16]But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear to you;
\[17]Delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,
\[18]To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
\[19]Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:
\[20]But showed first to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.
\[21]For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.
\[22]Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
\[23]That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.
\[24]And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.
\[25]But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
\[26]For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
\[27]King Agrippa, believe you the prophets? I know that you believe.
\[28]Then Agrippa said to Paul, Almost you persuade me to be a Christian.
\[29]And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
\[30]And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
\[31]And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
\[32]Then said Agrippa to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.

nd when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.
\[2]And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
\[3]And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go to his friends to refresh himself.
\[4]And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
\[5]And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
\[6]And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.
\[7]And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
\[8]And, hardly passing it, came to a place which is called The fair havens; near whereunto was the city of Lasea.
\[9]Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,
\[10]And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
\[11]Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
\[12]And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lies toward the south west and north west.
\[13]And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing there, they sailed close by Crete.
\[14]But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
\[15]And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.
\[16]And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:
\[17]Which when they had taken up, they used helps, under girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven.
\[18]And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;
\[19]And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
\[20]And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
\[21]But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the middle of them, and said, Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
\[22]And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.
\[23]For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
\[24]Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, see, God has given you all them that sail with you.
\[25]Why, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
\[26]However, we must be cast on a certain island.
\[27]But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;
\[28]And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.
\[29]Then fearing lest we should have fallen on rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
\[30]And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the bow,
\[31]Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved.
\[32]Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
\[33]And while the day was coming on, Paul sought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
\[34]Why I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
\[35]And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
\[36]Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
\[37]And we were in all in the ship two hundred three score and sixteen souls.
\[38]And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.
\[39]And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
\[40]And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
\[41]And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
\[42]And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
\[43]But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:
\[44]And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.  And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.

nd when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
\[2]And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
\[3]And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
\[4]And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffers not to live.
\[5]And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
\[6]However, they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
\[7]In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
\[8]And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
\[9]So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
\[10]Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.
\[11]And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
\[12]And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
\[13]And from there we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
\[14]Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
\[15]And from there, when the brothers heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
\[16]And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
\[17]And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said to them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
\[18]Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.
\[19]But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
\[20]For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
\[21]And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you.
\[22]But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
\[23]And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.
\[24]And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
\[25]And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,
\[26]Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:
\[27]For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
\[28]Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.
\[29]And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
\[30]And Paul dwelled two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in to him,
\[31]Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.

\[3]Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
\[4]And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
\[5]By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
\[6]Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:
\[7]To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[8]First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
\[9]For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
\[10]Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.
\[11]For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;
\[12]That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
\[13]Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
\[14]I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
\[15]So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
\[16]For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
\[17]For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
\[18]For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
\[19]Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.
\[20]For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
\[21]Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
\[22]Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
\[23]And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.
\[24]Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:
\[25]Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
\[26]For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
\[27]And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.
\[28]And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
\[29]Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
\[30]Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
\[31]Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
\[32]Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

herefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judge: for wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things.
\[2]But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
\[3]And think you this, O man, that judge them which do such things, and do the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?
\[4]Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?
\[5]But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
\[6]Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
\[7]To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:
\[8]But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
\[9]Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
\[10]But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
\[11]For there is no respect of persons with God.
\[12]For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
\[13](For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
\[14]For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:
\[15]Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
\[16]In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
\[17]Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,
\[18]And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
\[19]And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
\[20]An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
\[21]You therefore which teach another, teach you not yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?
\[22]You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?
\[23]You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonor you God?
\[24]For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
\[25]For circumcision truly profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.
\[26]Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
\[27]And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?
\[28]For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
\[29]But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.

hat advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
\[2]Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.
\[3]For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
\[4]God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.
\[5]But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)
\[6]God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
\[7]For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
\[8]And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
\[9]What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
\[10]As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
\[11]There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.
\[12]They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.
\[13]Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
\[14]Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
\[15]Their feet are swift to shed blood:
\[16]Destruction and misery are in their ways:
\[17]And the way of peace have they not known:
\[18]There is no fear of God before their eyes.
\[19]Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
\[20]Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
\[21]But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
\[22]Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:
\[23]For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
\[24]Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
\[25]Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
\[26]To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.
\[27]Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.
\[28]Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
\[29]Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
\[30]Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

hat shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?
\[2]For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God.
\[3]For what said the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
\[4]Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
\[5]But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
\[6]Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,
\[7]Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
\[8]Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
\[9]Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
\[10]How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
\[11]And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:
\[12]And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.
\[13]For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
\[14]For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
\[15]Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.
\[16]Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
\[17](As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who vivifies the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were.
\[18]Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be.
\[19]And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:
\[20]He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
\[21]And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
\[22]And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
\[23]Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
\[24]But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
\[25]Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.

herefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
\[2]By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
\[3]And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;
\[4]And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
\[5]And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.
\[6]For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
\[7]For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
\[8]But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
\[9]Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
\[10]For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
\[11]And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
\[12]Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:
\[13](For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
\[14]Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
\[15]But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.
\[16]And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification.
\[17]For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
\[18]Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came on all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came on all men to justification of life.
\[19]For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
\[20]Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
\[21]That as sin has reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

hat shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
\[2]God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
\[3]Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
\[4]Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
\[5]For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:
\[6]Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.
\[7]For he that is dead is freed from sin.
\[8]Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
\[9]Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.
\[10]For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.
\[11]Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
\[12]Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts thereof.
\[13]Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
\[14]For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.
\[15]What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
\[16]Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
\[17]But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
\[18]Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness.
\[19]I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.
\[20]For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.
\[21]What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.
\[22]But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.

now you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?
\[2]For the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
\[3]So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
\[4]Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.
\[5]For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.
\[6]But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
\[7]What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.
\[8]But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.
\[9]For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
\[10]And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be to death.
\[11]For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
\[12]Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
\[13]Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
\[14]For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
\[15]For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
\[16]If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good.
\[17]Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
\[18]For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
\[19]For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
\[20]Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
\[21]I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
\[22]For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
\[23]But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
\[24]O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
\[25]I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

here is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
\[2]For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.
\[3]For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
\[4]That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
\[5]For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
\[6]For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
\[7]Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
\[8]So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
\[9]But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
\[10]And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
\[11]But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.
\[12]Therefore, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
\[13]For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.
\[14]For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
\[15]For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
\[16]The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
\[17]And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
\[18]For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
\[19]For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.
\[20]For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,
\[21]Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
\[22]For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.
\[23]And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
\[24]For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?
\[25]But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
\[26]Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
\[27]And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
\[28]And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
\[29]For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
\[30]Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
\[31]What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
\[32]He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
\[33]Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.
\[34]Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
\[35]Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
\[36]As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
\[37]No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
\[38]For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
\[39]Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

\[17]For the scripture said to Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
\[18]Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.
\[19]You will say then to me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?
\[20]No but, O man, who are you that reply against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?
\[21]Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?
\[22]What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
\[23]And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared to glory,
\[24]Even us, whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
\[25]As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
\[26]And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
\[27]Esaias also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
\[28]For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make on the earth.
\[29]And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like to Gomorrha.
\[30]What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
\[31]But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.

\[3]For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.
\[4]For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.
\[5]For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.
\[6]But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)
\[7]Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
\[8]But what said it? The word is near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
\[9]That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.
\[10]For with the heart man believes to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.
\[11]For the scripture said, Whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.
\[12]For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call on him.
\[13]For whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\[14]How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
\[15]And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
\[16]But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias said, Lord, who has believed our report?
\[17]So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
\[18]But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
\[19]But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses said, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.
\[20]But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.
\[21]But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.

 say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
\[2]God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture said of Elias? how he makes intercession to God against Israel saying,
\[3]Lord, they have killed your prophets, and dig down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
\[4]But what said the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.
\[5]Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
\[6]And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
\[7]What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.
\[8](According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.
\[9]And David said, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them:
\[10]Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.
\[11]I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
\[12]Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?
\[13]For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:
\[14]If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.
\[15]For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
\[16]For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
\[17]And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
\[18]Boast not against the branches. But if you boast, you bore not the root, but the root you.
\[19]You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
\[20]Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Be not high minded, but fear:
\[21]For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not you.
\[22]Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.
\[23]And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
\[24]For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
\[25]For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.
\[26]And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
\[27]For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.
\[28]As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.
\[29]For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
\[30]For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
\[31]Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
\[32]For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.
\[33]O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
\[34]For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counselor?
\[35]Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?
\[36]For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

\[2]And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
\[3]For I say, through the grace given to me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.
\[4]For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
\[5]So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
\[6]Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
\[7]Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;
\[8]Or he that exhorts, on exhortation: he that gives, let him do it with simplicity; he that rules, with diligence; he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
\[9]Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; hold to that which is good.
\[10]Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;
\[11]Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
\[12]Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
\[13]Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
\[14]Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
\[15]Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
\[16]Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
\[17]Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
\[18]If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men.
\[19]Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.
\[20]Therefore if your enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.

\[3]For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:
\[4]For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that does evil.
\[5]Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

\[10]Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
\[11]And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
\[12]The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
\[13]Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.

\[2]For one believes that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eats herbs.
\[3]Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him which eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.
\[4]Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.
\[5]One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
\[6]He that regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks.
\[7]For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself.
\[8]For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
\[9]For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
\[10]But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nothing your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
\[11]For it is written, As I live, said the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
\[12]So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
\[13]Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.
\[14]I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
\[15]But if your brother be grieved with your meat, now walk you not charitably. Destroy not him with your meat, for whom Christ died.
\[16]Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
\[17]For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
\[18]For he that in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
\[19]Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another.
\[20]For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.
\[21]It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.
\[22]Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that comdemns not himself in that thing which he allows.
\[23]And he that doubts is damned if he eat, because he eats not of faith: for whatever is not of faith is sin.

\[2]Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.
\[3]For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me.
\[4]For whatever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
\[5]Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
\[6]That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[7]Why receive you one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
\[8]Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:
\[9]And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.
\[10]And again he said, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.
\[11]And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and laud him, all you people.
\[12]And again, Esaias said, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
\[13]Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
\[14]And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
\[15]Nevertheless, brothers, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
\[16]That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
\[17]I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
\[18]For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
\[19]Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
\[20]Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation:
\[21]But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
\[22]For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
\[23]But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;
\[24]Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.
\[25]But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.
\[26]For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
\[27]It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.
\[28]When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
\[29]And I am sure that, when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
\[30]Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
\[31]That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
\[32]That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

\[2]To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:
\[3]Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[4]I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
\[5]That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;
\[6]Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
\[7]So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
\[8]Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[9]God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
\[10]Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
\[11]For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
\[12]Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
\[13]Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
\[14]I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
\[15]Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.
\[16]And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
\[17]For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
\[18]For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.
\[19]For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
\[20]Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
\[21]For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
\[22]For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
\[23]But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;
\[24]But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
\[25]Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
\[26]For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:
\[27]But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
\[28]And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are:
\[29]That no flesh should glory in his presence.
\[30]But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
\[31]That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.

nd I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.
\[2]For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
\[3]And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
\[4]And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
\[5]That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
\[6]However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:
\[7]But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:
\[8]Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\[9]But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him.
\[10]But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
\[11]For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.
\[12]Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
\[13]Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
\[14]But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
\[15]But he that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
\[16]For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?  But we have the mind of Christ.

\[2]I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.
\[3]For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?
\[4]For while one said, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not carnal?
\[5]Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
\[6]I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
\[7]So then neither is he that plants any thing, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase.
\[8]Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
\[9]For we are laborers together with God: you are God's husbandry, you are God's building.
\[10]According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.
\[11]For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
\[12]Now if any man build on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
\[13]Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
\[14]If any man's work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
\[15]If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
\[16]Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
\[17]If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.
\[18]Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
\[19]For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.
\[20]And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
\[21]Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;
\[22]Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;

\[2]Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
\[3]But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.
\[4]For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.
\[5]Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
\[6]And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
\[7]For who makes you to differ from another? and what have you that you did not receive? now if you did receive it, why do you glory, as if you had not received it?
\[8]Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
\[9]For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.
\[10]We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised.
\[11]Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;
\[12]And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
\[13]Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things to this day.
\[14]I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.
\[15]For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
\[16]Why I beseech you, be you followers of me.
\[17]For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
\[18]Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
\[19]But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
\[20]For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
\[21]What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?

t is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
\[2]And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.
\[3]For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,
\[4]In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\[5]To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
\[6]Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
\[7]Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
\[8]Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
\[9]I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:
\[10]Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.
\[11]But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.
\[12]For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you judge them that are within?

\[2]Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
\[3]Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
\[4]If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
\[5]I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?
\[6]But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
\[7]Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
\[8]No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.
\[9]Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
\[10]Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
\[11]And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

\[13]Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
\[14]And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
\[15]Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
\[16]What? know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?  for two, said he, shall be one flesh.
\[17]But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
\[18]Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.
\[19]What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?

ow concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
\[2]Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
\[3]Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.
\[4]The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife.
\[5]Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
\[6]But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.
\[7]For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
\[8]I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
\[9]But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
\[10]And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:
\[11]But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.
\[12]But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
\[13]And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
\[14]For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
\[15]But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.
\[16]For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband?  or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?
\[17]But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
\[18]Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
\[19]Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
\[20]Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
\[21]Are you called being a servant? care not for it: but if you may be made free, use it rather.
\[22]For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.
\[23]You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.
\[24]Brothers, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
\[25]Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
\[26]I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.
\[27]Are you bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
\[28]But and if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
\[29]But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
\[30]And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
\[31]And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.
\[32]But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
\[33]But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.
\[34]There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
\[35]And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.
\[36]But if any man think that he behaves himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry.
\[37]Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.
\[38]So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better.
\[39]The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
\[40]But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

ow as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.
\[2]And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.
\[3]But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
\[4]As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.
\[5]For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
\[6]But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
\[7]However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
\[8]But meat commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
\[9]But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumbling block to them that are weak.
\[10]For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
\[11]And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
\[12]But when you sin so against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
\[13]Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.

\[2]If I be not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord.
\[3]My answer to them that do examine me is this,
\[4]Have we not power to eat and to drink?
\[5]Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
\[6]Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
\[7]Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?
\[8]Say I these things as a man? or said not the law the same also?
\[9]For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Does God take care for oxen?
\[10]Or said he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that plows should plow in hope; and that he that threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.
\[11]If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
\[12]If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?  Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
\[13]Do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
\[14]Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
\[15]But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
\[16]For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!
\[17]For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.
\[18]What is my reward then? Truly that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
\[19]For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.
\[20]And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
\[21]To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
\[22]To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.
\[23]And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.
\[24]Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.
\[25]And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
\[26]I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:
\[27]But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.

\[3]And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
\[4]And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
\[5]But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
\[6]Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
\[7]Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
\[8]Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
\[9]Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
\[10]Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
\[11]Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.
\[12]Why let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
\[13]There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.
\[14]Why, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
\[15]I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.
\[16]The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
\[17]For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
\[18]Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
\[19]What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
\[20]But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.
\[21]You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.
\[22]Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
\[23]All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
\[24]Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.
\[25]Whatever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
\[26]For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.
\[27]If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and you be disposed to go; whatever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
\[28]But if any man say to you, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof:
\[29]Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?
\[30]For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
\[31]Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
\[32]Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:

\[2]Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
\[3]But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
\[4]Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
\[5]But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
\[6]For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
\[7]For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
\[8]For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
\[9]Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
\[10]For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
\[11]Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
\[12]For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
\[13]Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered?
\[14]Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?
\[15]But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
\[16]But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
\[17]Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.
\[18]For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
\[19]For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
\[20]When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
\[21]For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
\[22]What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
\[23]For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
\[24]And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
\[25]After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.
\[26]For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come.
\[27]Why whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
\[28]But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
\[29]For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
\[30]For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
\[31]For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
\[32]But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
\[33]Why, my brothers, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another.
\[34]And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

ow concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.
\[2]You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as you were led.
\[3]Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
\[4]Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
\[5]And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
\[6]And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works all in all.
\[7]But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with.
\[8]For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
\[9]To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
\[10]To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
\[11]But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
\[12]For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
\[13]For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
\[14]For the body is not one member, but many.
\[15]If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
\[16]And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
\[17]If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
\[18]But now has God set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased him.
\[19]And if they were all one member, where were the body?
\[20]But now are they many members, yet but one body.
\[21]And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
\[22]No, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
\[23]And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
\[24]For our comely parts have no need: but God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked.
\[25]That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
\[26]And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.
\[27]Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
\[28]And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
\[29]Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
\[30]Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?

\[3]And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.

\[11]When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

ollow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.
\[2]For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.
\[3]But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
\[4]He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.
\[5]I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
\[6]Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
\[7]And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
\[8]For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
\[9]So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air.
\[10]There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.
\[11]Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.
\[12]Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.
\[13]Why let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
\[14]For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
\[15]What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
\[16]Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?
\[17]For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
\[18]I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:
\[19]Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
\[20]Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.
\[21]In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.
\[22]Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
\[23]If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?
\[24]But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
\[25]And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
\[26]How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.
\[27]If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.
\[28]But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
\[29]Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
\[30]If any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace.
\[31]For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
\[32]And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
\[33]For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
\[34]Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.
\[35]And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
\[36]What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?
\[37]If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
\[38]But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
\[39]Why, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
\[40]Let all things be done decently and in order.

oreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;
\[2]By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.
\[3]For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
\[4]And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
\[5]And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
\[6]After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.
\[7]After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
\[8]And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
\[9]For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
\[10]But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
\[11]Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
\[12]Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
\[13]But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
\[14]And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
\[15]Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
\[16]For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
\[17]And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.
\[18]Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
\[19]If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
\[20]But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.
\[21]For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
\[22]For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
\[23]But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
\[24]Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
\[25]For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.
\[26]The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
\[27]For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.
\[28]And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
\[29]Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
\[30]And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
\[31]I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.
\[32]If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
\[33]Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
\[34]Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
\[35]But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
\[36]You fool, that which you sow is not quickened, except it die:
\[37]And that which you sow, you sow not that body that shall be, but bore grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:
\[38]But God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
\[39]All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
\[40]There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
\[41]There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory.
\[42]So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
\[43]It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
\[44]It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
\[45]And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
\[46]However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
\[47]The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.
\[48]As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
\[49]And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
\[50]Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
\[51]Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
\[52]In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
\[53]For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
\[54]So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
\[55]O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?
\[56]The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
\[57]But thanks be to God, which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[58]Therefore, my beloved brothers, be you steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

\[16]That you submit yourselves to such, and to every one that helps with us, and labors.
\[17]I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
\[18]For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge you them that are such.

aul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
\[2]Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[3]Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
\[4]Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God.
\[5]For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.
\[6]And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
\[7]And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.
\[8]For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:
\[9]But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:
\[10]Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;
\[11]You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
\[12]For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
\[13]For we write none other things to you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;
\[14]As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.
\[15]And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;
\[16]And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
\[17]When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?
\[18]But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.
\[19]For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.
\[20]For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.
\[21]Now he which establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God;
\[22]Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
\[23]Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.
\[24]Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you stand.

ut I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
\[2]For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
\[3]And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
\[4]For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.
\[5]But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
\[6]Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.
\[7]So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
\[8]Why I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him.
\[9]For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.
\[10]To whom you forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;
\[11]Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
\[12]Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,
\[13]I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.
\[14]Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.
\[15]For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
\[16]To the one we are the smell of death to death; and to the other the smell of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?
\[17]For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

o we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
\[2]You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
\[3]For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
\[4]And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
\[5]Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
\[6]Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.
\[7]But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:
\[8]How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
\[9]For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
\[10]For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excels.
\[11]For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious.
\[12]Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
\[13]And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
\[14]But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ.
\[15]But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.
\[16]Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.
\[17]Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
\[18]But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.

\[2]But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
\[3]But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
\[4]In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.
\[5]For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
\[6]For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
\[7]But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
\[8]We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
\[9]Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
\[10]Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
\[11]For we which live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
\[12]So then death works in us, but life in you.

\[14]Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.
\[15]For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
\[16]For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
\[17]For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
\[18]While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

or we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
\[2]For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed on with our house which is from heaven:
\[3]If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
\[4]For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
\[5]Now he that has worked us for the selfsame thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.
\[6]Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
\[7](For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
\[8]We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
\[9]Why we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
\[10]For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.
\[11]Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
\[12]For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
\[13]For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.
\[14]For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
\[15]And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.
\[16]Why from now on know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now from now on know we him no more.
\[17]Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
\[18]And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
\[19]To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
\[20]Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be you reconciled to God.

\[6]Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
\[7]And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
\[8]For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.
\[9]Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.
\[10]For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.
\[11]For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
\[12]Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.
\[13]Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
\[14]For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.
\[15]And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.
\[16]I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.

oreover, brothers, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
\[2]How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.
\[3]For to their power, I bear record, yes, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;
\[4]Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
\[5]And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
\[6]So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
\[7]Therefore, as you abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also.
\[8]I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
\[9]For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich.
\[10]And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
\[11]Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.
\[12]For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not.
\[13]For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened:
\[14]But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:
\[15]As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.
\[16]But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
\[17]For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went to you.
\[18]And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
\[19]And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:
\[20]Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
\[21]Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
\[22]And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.
\[23]Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.
\[24]Why show you to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

or as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
\[2]For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.
\[3]Yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:
\[4]Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
\[5]Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.
\[6]But this I say, He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
\[7]Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
\[8]And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:
\[9](As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains for ever.
\[10]Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
\[11]Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God.
\[12]For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;
\[13]Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;
\[14]And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
\[15]Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.

ow I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
\[2]But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
\[3]For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
\[4](For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
\[5]Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
\[6]And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
\[7]Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.
\[8]For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
\[9]That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
\[10]For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
\[11]Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.
\[12]For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
\[13]But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.
\[14]For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:
\[15]Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
\[16]To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.
\[17]But he that glories, let him glory in the Lord.

ould to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
\[2]For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
\[3]But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
\[4]For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him.
\[5]For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.
\[6]But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.
\[7]Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
\[8]I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
\[9]And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.
\[10]As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
\[11]Why? because I love you not? God knows.
\[12]But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
\[13]For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
\[14]And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
\[15]Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
\[16]I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
\[17]That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
\[18]Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
\[19]For you suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.
\[20]For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
\[21]I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. However, when ever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
\[22]Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
\[23]Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
\[24]Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
\[25]Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
\[26]In journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brothers;
\[27]In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
\[28]Beside those things that are without, that which comes on me daily, the care of all the churches.
\[29]Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
\[30]If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.
\[31]The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.
\[32]In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

t is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
\[2]I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
\[3]And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;)
\[4]How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
\[5]Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.
\[6]For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me to be, or that he hears of me.
\[7]And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
\[8]For this thing I sought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
\[9]And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.
\[10]Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
\[11]I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.
\[12]Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
\[13]For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
\[14]Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
\[15]And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
\[16]But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
\[17]Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?
\[18]I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?
\[19]Again, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
\[20]For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:
\[21]And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.

\[2]I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
\[3]Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
\[4]For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
\[5]Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?
\[6]But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.
\[7]Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
\[8]For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
\[9]For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.
\[10]Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.

\[12]Greet one another with an holy kiss.

\[10]For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

\[12]For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

\[14]And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
\[15]But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,
\[16]To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
\[17]Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
\[18]Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.
\[19]But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.
\[20]Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.
\[21]Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
\[22]And was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:

hen fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
\[2]And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
\[3]But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
\[4]And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
\[5]To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
\[6]But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:
\[7]But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter;
\[8](For he that worked effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
\[9]And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.
\[10]Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
\[11]But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
\[12]For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
\[13]And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
\[14]But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
\[15]We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
\[16]Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
\[17]But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.
\[18]For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
\[19]For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.
\[20]I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

 foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
\[2]This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
\[3]Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?
\[4]Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
\[5]He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
\[6]Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
\[7]Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
\[8]And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed.
\[9]So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
\[10]For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
\[11]But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
\[12]And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them.
\[13]Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:
\[14]That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
\[15]Brothers, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man cancels, or adds thereto.
\[16]Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.
\[17]And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.
\[18]For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
\[19]Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
\[20]Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
\[21]Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.
\[22]But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
\[23]But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
\[24]Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
\[25]But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
\[26]For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
\[27]For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
\[28]There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

\[22]For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a female slave, the other by a free woman.
\[23]But he who was of the female slave was born after the flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise.
\[24]Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.
\[25]For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
\[26]But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
\[27]For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bore not; break forth and cry, you that travail not: for the desolate has many more children than she which has an husband.
\[28]Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
\[29]But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.
\[30]Nevertheless what said the scripture? Cast out the female slave and her son: for the son of the female slave shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.
\[31]So then, brothers, we are not children of the female slave, but of the free.

tand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
\[2]Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
\[3]For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
\[4]Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace.
\[5]For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
\[6]For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.
\[7]You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?
\[8]This persuasion comes not of him that calls you.
\[9]A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
\[10]I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he be.
\[11]And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.
\[12]I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
\[13]For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
\[14]For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
\[15]But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.
\[16]This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
\[17]For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.
\[18]But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law.
\[19]Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
\[20]Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
\[21]Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
\[22]But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
\[23]Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
\[24]And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
\[25]If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
\[26]Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.

rothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.
\[2]Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
\[3]For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
\[4]But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
\[5]For every man shall bear his own burden.
\[6]Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.
\[7]Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.
\[8]For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
\[9]And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
\[10]As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.
\[11]You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.
\[12]As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
\[13]For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
\[14]But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
\[15]For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
\[16]And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.
\[17]From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
\[18]Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.

\[4]According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:

\[6]To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.
\[7]In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
\[8]Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
\[9]Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:
\[10]That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:
\[11]In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:
\[12]That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
\[13]In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
\[14]Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.
\[15]Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,

\[17]That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:

\[3]Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
\[4]But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,

\[10]For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.
\[11]Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
\[12]That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
\[13]But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.
\[14]For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
\[15]Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;
\[16]And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
\[17]And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.
\[18]For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
\[19]Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

\[7]Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.

\[14]For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\[15]Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

\[18]May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
\[19]And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.

 therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,
\[2]With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;
\[3]Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
\[4]There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;
\[5]One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
\[6]One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
\[7]But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
\[8]Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.
\[9](Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
\[10]He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
\[11]And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
\[12]For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
\[13]Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:
\[14]That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
\[15]But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:
\[16]From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.
\[17]This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
\[18]Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
\[19]Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
\[20]But you have not so learned Christ;
\[21]If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
\[22]That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
\[23]And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
\[24]And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
\[25]Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
\[26]Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath:
\[27]Neither give place to the devil.
\[28]Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.
\[29]Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.
\[30]And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.
\[31]Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
\[32]And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.

\[3]But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;
\[4]Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
\[5]For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
\[6]Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.
\[7]Be not you therefore partakers with them.
\[8]For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
\[9](For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
\[10]Proving what is acceptable to the Lord.
\[11]And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

\[13]But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatever does make manifest is light.
\[14]Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.
\[15]See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
\[16]Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
\[17]Why be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
\[18]And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
\[19]Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
\[20]Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\[21]Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
\[22]Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
\[23]For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.
\[24]Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.
\[25]Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
\[26]That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
\[27]That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
\[28]So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.
\[29]For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church:
\[30]For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
\[31]For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
\[32]This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

\[4]Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,
\[5]For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
\[6]Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:
\[7]Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.
\[8]For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
\[9]And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;
\[10]That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ.
\[11]Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
\[12]But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;
\[13]So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;
\[14]And many of the brothers in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
\[15]Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
\[16]The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
\[17]But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.
\[18]What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.
\[19]For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
\[20]According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.
\[21]For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
\[22]But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.
\[23]For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
\[24]Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
\[25]And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
\[26]That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
\[27]Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
\[28]And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
\[29]For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

\[3]Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
\[4]Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
\[5]Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
\[6]Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
\[7]But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
\[8]And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.
\[9]Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
\[10]That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
\[11]And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
\[12]Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
\[13]For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
\[14]Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
\[15]That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;
\[16]Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.
\[17]Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
\[18]For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.
\[19]But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
\[20]For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.
\[21]For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
\[22]But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.
\[23]Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
\[24]But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
\[25]Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

\[27]For indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow on sorrow.
\[28]I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
\[29]Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
\[30]Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

inally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.
\[2]Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
\[3]For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
\[4]Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
\[5]Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
\[6]Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
\[7]But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
\[8]Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,
\[9]And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
\[10]That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;
\[11]If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.
\[12]Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
\[13]Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,
\[14]I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
\[15]Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.
\[16]Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
\[17]Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.
\[18](For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:
\[19]Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
\[20]For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:
\[21]Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.

\[2]I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
\[3]And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.
\[4]Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.
\[5]Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
\[6]Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
\[7]And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
\[8]Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
\[9]Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
\[10]But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.
\[11]Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content.
\[12]I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
\[13]I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
\[14]Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.
\[15]Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.
\[16]For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.
\[17]Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
\[18]But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.
\[19]But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
\[20]Now to God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\[21]Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers which are with me greet you.
\[22]All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.

aul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,
\[2]To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\[3]We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
\[4]Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,
\[5]For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
\[6]Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:
\[7]As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
\[8]Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
\[9]For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
\[10]That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
\[11]Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;
\[12]Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
\[13]Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
\[14]In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
\[15]Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
\[16]For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
\[17]And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
\[18]And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
\[19]For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;
\[20]And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.
\[21]And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled
\[22]In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:
\[23]If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
\[24]Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:
\[25]Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;
\[26]Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
\[27]To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
\[28]Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
\[29]Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.

or I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
\[2]That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
\[3]In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
\[4]And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
\[5]For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
\[6]As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:
\[7]Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
\[8]Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
\[9]For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
\[10]And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:
\[11]In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:
\[12]Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.
\[13]And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
\[14]Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
\[15]And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
\[16]Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:
\[17]Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
\[18]Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
\[19]And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.
\[20]Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,
\[21](Touch not; taste not; handle not;
\[22]Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?

\[2]Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
\[3]For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
\[4]When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.
\[5]Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
\[6]For which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience:
\[7]In the which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.
\[8]But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
\[9]Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;
\[10]And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
\[11]Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.
\[12]Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
\[13]Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.
\[14]And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.
\[15]And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.
\[16]Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
\[17]And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
\[18]Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.

\[22]Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;
\[23]And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;
\[24]Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.

or yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:
\[2]But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.
\[3]For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
\[4]But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.
\[5]For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:
\[6]Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
\[7]But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:
\[8]So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.
\[9]For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.
\[10]You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
\[11]As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,
\[12]That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.
\[13]For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.
\[14]For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:
\[15]Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
\[16]Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.
\[17]But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
\[18]Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
\[19]For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

\[4]That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;
\[5]Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
\[6]That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
\[7]For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.
\[8]He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.
\[9]But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

\[11]And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
\[12]That you may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that you may have lack of nothing.
\[13]But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
\[14]For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
\[15]For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
\[16]For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
\[17]Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

\[3]For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
\[4]But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
\[5]You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
\[6]Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
\[7]For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
\[8]But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
\[9]For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
\[10]Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
\[11]Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.
\[12]And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
\[13]And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
\[14]Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
\[15]See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.
\[16]Rejoice ever more.
\[17]Pray without ceasing.
\[18]In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
\[19]Quench not the Spirit.
\[20]Despise not prophesyings.
\[21]Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
\[22]Abstain from all appearance of evil.
\[23]And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

\[2]That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
\[3]Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
\[4]Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.
\[5]Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
\[6]And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.
\[7]For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.
\[8]And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
\[9]Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
\[10]And with all delusion of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
\[11]And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
\[12]That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
\[13]But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
\[14]Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[15]Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.
\[16]Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
\[17]Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.

\[2]And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.
\[3]But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.
\[4]And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.
\[5]And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.
\[6]Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.
\[7]For yourselves know how you ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
\[8]Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
\[9]Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample to you to follow us.
\[10]For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
\[11]For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
\[12]Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
\[13]But you, brothers, be not weary in well doing.
\[14]And if any man obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
\[15]Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

\[17]The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.
\[18]The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

\[2]To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
\[3]As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
\[4]Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.
\[5]Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:
\[6]From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain jangling;
\[7]Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
\[8]But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
\[9]Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for murderers,
\[10]For fornicators, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for enslavers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
\[11]According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
\[12]And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
\[13]Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
\[14]And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
\[15]This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
\[16]However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
\[17]Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\[18]This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;

\[15]Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
\[16]But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.
\[17]And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;

\[19]Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
\[20]But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.

\[22]Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
\[23]But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do engender strifes.
\[24]And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,
\[25]In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

herefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.
\[2]For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;
\[3]How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;
\[4]God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
\[5]For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
\[6]But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?
\[7]You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:
\[8]You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.  But now we see not yet all things put under him.
\[9]But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
\[10]For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
\[11]For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,
\[12]Saying, I will declare your name to my brothers, in the middle of the church will I sing praise to you.
\[13]And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.
\[14]For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
\[15]And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
\[16]For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.
\[17]Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
\[18]For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.

hy, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
\[2]Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.
\[3]For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.
\[4]For every house is built by some man; but he that built all things is God.
\[5]And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
\[6]But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.
\[7]Why (as the Holy Ghost said, To day if you will hear his voice,
\[8]Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
\[9]When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
\[10]Why I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.
\[11]So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
\[12]Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
\[13]But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
\[14]For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;
\[15]While it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
\[16]For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
\[17]But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
\[18]And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

et us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
\[2]For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
\[3]For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
\[4]For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
\[5]And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.
\[6]Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
\[7]Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
\[8]For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
\[9]There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.
\[10]For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
\[11]Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
\[12]For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
\[13]Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
\[14]Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
\[15]For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
\[16]Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

or every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:

herefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
\[2]Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
\[3]And this will we do, if God permit.
\[4]For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
\[5]And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
\[6]If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
\[7]For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes oft on it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God:
\[8]But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is near to cursing; whose end is to be burned.
\[9]But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
\[10]For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
\[11]And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:
\[12]That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
\[13]For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
\[14]Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.
\[15]And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
\[16]For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
\[17]Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:
\[18]That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us:
\[19]Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;

or this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
\[2]To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
\[3]Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like to the Son of God; stays a priest continually.
\[4]Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
\[5]And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
\[6]But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
\[7]And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
\[8]And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.
\[9]And as I may so say, Levi also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.
\[10]For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
\[11]If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
\[12]For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
\[13]For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
\[14]For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
\[15]And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there rises another priest,
\[16]Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
\[17]For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
\[18]For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
\[19]For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.
\[20]And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:
\[21](For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
\[22]By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
\[23]And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
\[24]But this man, because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood.
\[25]Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.
\[26]For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
\[27]Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
\[28]For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for ever more.

ow of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
\[2]A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
\[3]For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
\[4]For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
\[5]Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.
\[6]But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.
\[7]For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
\[8]For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
\[9]Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, said the Lord.
\[10]For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
\[11]And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
\[12]For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
\[13]In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.

hen truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
\[2]For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.
\[3]And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
\[4]Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
\[5]And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
\[6]Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
\[7]But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
\[8]The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
\[9]Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
\[10]Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
\[11]But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
\[12]Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.
\[13]For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:
\[14]How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
\[15]And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
\[16]For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
\[17]For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives.
\[18]Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.
\[19]For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
\[20]Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined to you.
\[21]Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
\[22]And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
\[23]It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
\[24]For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
\[25]Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;
\[26]For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
\[27]And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:
\[28]So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.

or the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
\[2]For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
\[3]But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
\[4]For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
\[5]Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:
\[6]In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.
\[7]Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.
\[8]Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;
\[9]Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.
\[10]By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
\[11]And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
\[12]But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
\[13]From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
\[14]For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
\[15]Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
\[16]This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, said the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
\[17]And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
\[18]Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
\[19]Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
\[20]By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
\[21]And having an high priest over the house of God;
\[22]Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
\[23]Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
\[24]And let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works:
\[25]Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.
\[26]For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,
\[27]But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
\[28]He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
\[29]Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?
\[30]For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
\[31]It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
\[32]But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;
\[33]Partly, whilst you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst you became companions of them that were so used.
\[34]For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
\[35]Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.
\[36]For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.
\[37]For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
\[38]Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
\[39]But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

ow faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
\[2]For by it the elders obtained a good report.
\[3]Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
\[4]By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.
\[5]By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
\[6]But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
\[7]By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
\[8]By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.
\[9]By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
\[10]For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
\[11]Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
\[12]Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
\[13]These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
\[14]For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
\[15]And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
\[16]But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: why God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.
\[17]By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
\[18]Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall your seed be called:
\[19]Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from where also he received him in a figure.
\[20]By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
\[21]By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning on the top of his staff.
\[22]By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
\[23]By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
\[24]By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
\[25]Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
\[26]Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward.
\[27]By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
\[28]Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
\[29]By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
\[30]By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
\[31]By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
\[32]And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:
\[33]Who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.
\[34]Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
\[35]Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
\[36]And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
\[37]They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
\[38](Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
\[39]And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
\[40]God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

hy seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
\[2]Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
\[3]For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.
\[4]You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.
\[5]And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:
\[6]For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and whips every son whom he receives.
\[7]If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?
\[8]But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.
\[9]Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?
\[10]For they truly for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
\[11]Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them which are exercised thereby.
\[12]Why lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
\[13]And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
\[14]Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
\[15]Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;
\[16]Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
\[17]For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
\[18]For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
\[19]And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
\[20](For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
\[21]And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
\[22]But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
\[23]To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
\[24]And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.
\[25]See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:
\[26]Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
\[27]And this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
\[28]Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
\[29]For our God is a consuming fire.

\[19]But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.

ames, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
\[2]My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;
\[3]Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.
\[4]But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
\[5]If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.
\[6]But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
\[7]For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
\[8]A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
\[9]Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
\[10]But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
\[11]For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it wither the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
\[12]Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.
\[13]Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:
\[14]But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
\[15]Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.
\[16]Do not err, my beloved brothers.
\[17]Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.
\[18]Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
\[19]Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
\[20]For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.
\[21]Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
\[22]But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
\[23]For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
\[24]For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and straightway forgets what manner of man he was.
\[25]But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
\[26]If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
\[27]Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

y brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.
\[2]For if there come to your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
\[3]And you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say to him, Sit you here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand you there, or sit here under my footstool:
\[4]Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
\[5]Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?
\[6]But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
\[7]Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you are called?
\[8]If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well:
\[9]But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
\[10]For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
\[11]For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you are become a transgressor of the law.
\[12]So speak you, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
\[13]For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.
\[14]What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
\[15]If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
\[16]And one of you say to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?
\[17]Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone.
\[18]Yes, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
\[19]You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
\[20]But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
\[21]Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?
\[22]See you how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
\[23]And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
\[24]You see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
\[25]Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?
\[26]For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

y brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
\[2]For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
\[3]Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
\[4]Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, wherever the governor wants.
\[5]Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things.  Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!
\[6]And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
\[7]For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:
\[8]But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
\[9]Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
\[10]Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not so to be.
\[11]Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
\[12]Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
\[13]Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
\[14]But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
\[15]This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
\[16]For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
\[17]But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

\[3]You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it on your lusts.
\[4]You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
\[5]Do you think that the scripture said in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?

\[11]Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
\[12]But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.
\[13]Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
\[14]Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
\[15]And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
\[16]Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.
\[17]Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
\[18]And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
\[19]Brothers, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;

hy laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,
\[2]As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:
\[3]If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.
\[4]To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,
\[5]You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
\[6]Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.
\[7]To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
\[8]And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
\[9]But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;
\[10]Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
\[11]Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;
\[12]Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
\[13]Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
\[14]Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
\[15]For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
\[16]As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
\[17]Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
\[18]Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.
\[19]For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
\[20]For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
\[21]For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:
\[22]Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
\[23]Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:
\[24]Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.
\[25]For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

ikewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;
\[2]While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.
\[3]Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
\[4]But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
\[5]For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
\[6]Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
\[7]Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.
\[8]Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:
\[9]Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.
\[10]For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
\[11]Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.
\[12]For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.
\[13]And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?
\[14]But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
\[15]But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
\[16]Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.
\[17]For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.
\[18]For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
\[19]By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;
\[20]Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
\[21]The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:
\[22]Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.

or as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;
\[2]That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
\[3]For the time past of our life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, parties, and abominable idolatries:
\[4]Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
\[5]Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
\[6]For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
\[7]But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.
\[8]And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
\[9]Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
\[10]As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
\[11]If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\[12]Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:
\[13]But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.
\[14]If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
\[15]But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.
\[16]Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
\[17]For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?
\[18]And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
\[19]Why let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.

imon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:
\[2]Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
\[3]According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:
\[4]Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
\[5]And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
\[6]And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
\[7]And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
\[8]For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[9]But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
\[10]Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:
\[11]For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
\[12]Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.
\[13]Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
\[14]Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.
\[15]Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
\[16]For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
\[17]For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
\[18]And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
\[19]We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
\[20]Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
\[21]For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

ut there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.
\[2]And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
\[3]And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.
\[4]For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;
\[5]And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;
\[6]And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample to those that after should live ungodly;
\[7]And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:
\[8](For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
\[9]The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:
\[10]But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
\[11]Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.
\[12]But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
\[13]And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
\[14]Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
\[15]Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
\[16]But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet.
\[17]These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
\[18]For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
\[19]While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
\[20]For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
\[21]For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
\[22]But it is happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

his second letter, beloved, I now write to you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
\[2]That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:
\[3]Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
\[4]And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
\[5]For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
\[6]Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
\[7]But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved to fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
\[8]But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
\[9]The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
\[10]But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
\[11]Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
\[12]Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
\[13]Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.
\[14]Why, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
\[15]And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;
\[16]As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.
\[17]You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness.
\[18]But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

\[2]And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
\[3]And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
\[4]He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
\[5]But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
\[6]He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
\[7]Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.
\[8]Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.
\[9]He that said he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.
\[10]He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.
\[11]But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.
\[12]I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
\[13]I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.
\[14]I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God stays in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.
\[15]Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
\[16]For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
\[17]And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God stays for ever.
\[18]Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
\[19]They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
\[20]But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.
\[21]I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
\[22]Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.
\[23]Whoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father: he that acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
\[24]Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.
\[25]And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life.
\[26]These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you.
\[27]But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.
\[28]And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

\[3]And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.

\[14]We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He that loves not his brother stays in death.
\[15]Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
\[16]Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
\[17]But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?
\[18]My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
\[19]And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
\[20]For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
\[21]Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
\[22]And whatever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
\[23]And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

\[16]And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.
\[17]Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
\[18]There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love.
\[19]We love him, because he first loved us.
\[20]If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
\[21]And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God love his brother also.

hoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.
\[2]By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.
\[3]For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
\[4]For whatever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.
\[5]Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
\[6]This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.
\[7]For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
\[8]And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
\[9]If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.
\[10]He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.
\[11]And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
\[12]He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life.
\[13]These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.
\[14]And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:
\[15]And if we know that he hear us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
\[16]If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not to death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not to death. There is a sin to death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.
\[17]All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not to death.
\[18]We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.
\[19]And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.
\[20]And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
\[21]Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

ude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:
\[2]Mercy to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
\[3]Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.
\[4]For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
\[5]I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
\[6]And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.
\[7]Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
\[8]Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
\[9]Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.
\[10]But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.
\[11]Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
\[12]These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
\[13]Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.
\[14]And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,
\[15]To execute judgment on all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
\[16]These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.
\[17]But, beloved, remember you the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
\[18]How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.
\[19]These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.
\[20]But you, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,
\[21]Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
\[22]And of some have compassion, making a difference:
\[23]And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
\[24]Now to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
\[25]To the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

\[6]And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\[7]Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
\[8]I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
\[9]I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
\[10]I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
\[11]Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What you see, write in a book, and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
\[12]And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
\[13]And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.
\[14]His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
\[15]And his feet like to fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
\[16]And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.
\[17]And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand on me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
\[18]I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

\[2]I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can not bear them which are evil: and you have tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars:
\[3]And have borne, and have patience, and for my name's sake have labored, and have not fainted.
\[4]Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.
\[5]Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his place, except you repent.
\[6]But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
\[7]He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.
\[8]And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things said the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
\[9]I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
\[10]Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.
\[11]He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.
\[12]And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things said he which has the sharp sword with two edges;
\[13]I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.
\[14]But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
\[15]So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.
\[16]Repent; or else I will come to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
\[17]He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.
\[18]And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things said the Son of God, who has his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;
\[19]I know your works, and charity, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.
\[20]Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
\[21]And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
\[22]Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
\[23]And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.
\[24]But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put on you none other burden.
\[25]But that which you have already hold fast till I come.
\[26]And he that overcomes, and keeps my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
\[27]And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
\[28]And I will give him the morning star.

\[11]Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which you have, that no man take your crown.
\[12]Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God: and I will write on him my new name.

\[17]Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
\[18]I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.
\[19]As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
\[20]Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

\[14]And I said to him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
\[15]Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.

\[3]And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.
\[4]And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.
\[5]And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunder, and lightning, and an earthquake.
\[6]And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
\[7]The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast on the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
\[8]And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
\[9]And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
\[10]And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell on the third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters;
\[11]And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
\[12]And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

\[2]And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
\[3]And there came out of the smoke locusts on the earth: and to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
\[4]And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
\[5]And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he strikes a man.
\[6]And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
\[7]And the shapes of the locusts were like to horses prepared to battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
\[8]And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
\[9]And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
\[10]And they had tails like to scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.
\[11]And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon.

\[13]And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
\[14]Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
\[15]And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
\[16]And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
\[17]And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
\[18]By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
\[19]For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like to serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
\[20]And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
\[21]Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

\[7]And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
\[8]And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
\[9]And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

\[16]And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
\[17]For in one hour so great riches is come to nothing. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
\[18]And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to this great city!
\[19]And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
\[20]Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her.
\[21]And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
\[22]And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsman, of whatever craft he be, shall be found any more in you; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you;
\[23]And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in you; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in you: for your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your sorceries were all nations deceived.
\[24]And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain on the earth.

nd after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, to the Lord our God:
\[2]For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
\[3]And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
\[4]And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
\[5]And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you his servants, and you that fear him, both small and great.
\[6]And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns.
\[7]Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.
\[8]And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
\[9]And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true sayings of God.
\[10]And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
\[11]And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.
\[12]His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
\[13]And he was clothed with a clothing dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
\[14]And the armies which were in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
\[15]And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
\[16]And he has on his clothing and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
\[17]And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the middle of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;
\[18]That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.
\[19]And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
\[20]And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
\[21]And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

nd I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
\[2]And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
\[3]And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
\[4]And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark on their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
\[5]But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
\[6]Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
\[7]And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
\[8]And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
\[9]And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
\[10]And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
\[11]And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
\[12]And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
\[13]And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
\[14]And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
\[15]And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

nd I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
\[2]And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
\[3]And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.
\[4]And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
\[5]And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.  And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
\[6]And he said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.
\[7]He that overcomes shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
\[8]But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
\[9]And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.
\[10]And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
\[11]Having the glory of God: and her light was like to a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
\[12]And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
\[13]On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
\[14]And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
\[15]And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
\[16]And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.  The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
\[17]And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
\[18]And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like to clear glass.
\[19]And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
\[20]The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
\[21]And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
\[22]And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
\[23]And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.
\[24]And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it.
\[25]And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
\[26]And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
\[27]And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

nd he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
\[2]In the middle of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
\[3]And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
\[4]And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.
\[5]And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
\[6]And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.
\[7]Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.
\[8]And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.
\[9]Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.
\[10]And he said to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.
\[11]He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
\[12]And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
\[13]I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
\[14]Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
\[15]For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.
\[16]I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.
\[17]And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
\[18]For I testify to every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:
\[19]And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
\[20]He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen.  Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
\[21]The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
